However , after a Russell Westbrook shot tied the game at 93 with just over five minutes left , Philly rattled off a quick 80 run and never surrendered the lead from that point . It was the 76ers fourth win in their last five games . Tobias Harris came up huge for Philadelphia , playing one of his best games since joining the team at the trade deadline . Harris finished with a game - high on 11 - of - 19 shooting from the floor to go along with five rebounds and three assists in 40 minutes .

Jimmy Butler added an impressive all - around performance of his own , posting 20 points , eight rebounds and eight assists in 37 minutes . For the Thunder , it was Jerami Grant who stepped up in George 's absence and played one of his best games of the season . Grant was 10 - of - 17 from the field on his way to recording 23 points and six rebounds in 37 minutes . Westbrook matched Grant 's 23 points , but did so on a very inefficient 8 - of - 24 shooting performance . He did put together yet another triple - double , however , posting 11 rebounds and 11 assists ."
