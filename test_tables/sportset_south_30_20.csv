Allen Crabbe paced the Portland bench with the only other double - digit scoring effort on the team , amassing 14 points and adding four rebounds and an assist .

Victor Oladipo was also outstanding off the bench , pouring 15 points and adding six assists , four rebounds , three steals and a block over a robust 35 minutes .
