The Pelicans were led by Ryan Anderson , who tallied 24 points and six rebounds while replacing Davis . The perimeter defense was the key to the loss though , as they allowed 15 three - pointers , with many of them being open shots . That 's been the problem with this team all year and they 'll need to fix that if they want to dig out of this deep hole they are digging themselves . If Davis is to miss significant time , this defense will only get worse . The scary thing for the Pelicans is that they have try to stop the unstoppable Russell Westbrook on Wednesday when they travel to Oklahoma City to take on the Thunder .
