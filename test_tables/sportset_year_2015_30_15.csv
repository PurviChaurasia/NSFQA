The Kings found out earlier in the afternoon that they 'd lost starting power forward DeMarcus Cousins for the night , due to a suspension stemming from his forearm shot on Al Horford in Wednesday night 's contest versus the Hawks . The ripple effect of his absence brought Kosta Koufos and Omri Casspi into the starting lineup for Sacramento , which could have used their All-Star big man , particularly during a valiant effort to close their deficit in the second half . Although they found themselves in a 56 - 46 hole at the half , the Kings did finish with a healthy total of 109 points due to a number of valuable contributions across the lineup . Rajon Rondo held up his end of the bargain trying to keep the Kings offense running on all cylinders , coming within a rebound of a second consecutive triple - double and fourth in five games . The veteran point guard poured in 14 points and 18 assists , while hauling in nine boards for good measure . Rudy Gay supported Rondo 's effort with a double - double performance of his own , posting 13 points , 12 rebounds , a pair of assists , and a steal . Meanwhile , Casspi played a season - high 39 minutes and was productive with the extended court time , chipping in with a 16 - point , six - rebound effort . Ben McLemore continued to show signs of offensive life after a rough start to the season , amassing double - digit points ( 17 ) for the second consecutive night . Notably , Marco Belinelli contributed a season - high 23 points off the bench in a highly efficient 26 minutes . The Kings fell to 4 - 9 and currently reside in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They next head to Orlando for a date with the Magic on Saturday . The Heat benefited from strong bounce - back efforts from their two veteran stars , Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade . The All-Stars had each suffered through middling performances versus the Timberwolves on Tuesday , but took advantage of their respective favorable matchups against Sacramento . Free of having to bump bodies with Cousins all night , Bosh posted 23 points , 11 rebounds , four assists and a block in one of his most complete performances of the year . Wade stuffed the stat sheet as well , amassing 24 points , six assists , five rebounds and a pair of steals against the Kings ' vulnerable shooting guard defense . Hassan Whiteside had a relatively quiet game by his standards and could n't get on the stat sheet until well into the second quarter , but finished with a respectable 12 points , five rebounds , a pair of steals and four more blocks . Much like his Kings shooting guard counterpart Belinelli , Tyler Johnson turned in an impressive performance in a reserve role for Miami , pacing the Heat bench with 19 points over 25 minutes . The Heat improved to 7 - 4 and remain in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They remain home for a showdown with the Sixers on Saturday ."

He had a brutal showing against the Golden State Warriors on Friday , where he shot just 14 percent ( 2 - for - 14 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt ) from the field , so it was good to see him get back on track Sunday .

Nick Collison was the only other Thunder player to score in double figures with 12 points in 26 minutes . Despite the dominating victory , Oklahoma City did not get the loss from the Pelicans that they needed to reach the playoffs , as they defeated the Spurs , and the Thunder have been eliminated from playoff contention just one year after reaching the Western Conference finals .

The game was a tale of two halves , with Chicago building a 50 - 40 lead by intermission , largely on the strength of a second period in which they outscored the visitors 29 - 19 . However , Indiana came out of the locker room ready to play catch - up in the third period , and clawed all the way back to take a 91 - 89 lead on a Monta Ellis layup with 31 seconds remaining in regulation . Jimmy Butler then made a clutch driving layup for the Bulls at the 25 - second mark to knot things up at 91 .

While no other starter was able to get into double - digits scoring - wise , two very productive performances off the bench were crucial to Chicago 's cause . With Derrick Rose sitting with a sore hamstring , Aaron Brooks showed he had the hot hand early despite yielding the start to Kirk Hinrich , and ended up playing a robust 41 minutes . Brooks tallied a season - high 29 points , and was successful on four of his seven three - point tries . While he did turn the ball over six times , he provided some badly - needed scoring punch in Rose 's stead . 2015 first - round pick Bobby Portis also pitched in significantly off the bench with 16 points , seven rebounds , a steal and a block . The Bulls improved to 18 - 12 and are now in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division.They remain home for a New Year 's Day matchup against the Knicks ."

Fellow frontcourt presence Paul Millsap dropped 20 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 8 - 10 FT ) , along with eight rebounds , four assists and two steals . Dennis Schroder led Atlanta in scoring with 22 points ( 8 - 15 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) in 28 minutes off the bench . He also dished five assists and grabbed four steals . Isaiah Thomas was electric as usual for the Celtics . Thomas led all scorers with 29 points on 6 - 12 shooting including 3 - 5 from beyond the arc but most notably shot 14 - 15 from the free throw line . Jae Crowder had one of his better games this season , finishing with 24 points ( 8 - 13 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) and 10 rebounds in 36 minutes . The only other player to score double digits for Boston was Jared Sullinger , who finished with 10 points ( 4 - 7 FG ) , along with eight rebounds , three assists and one steal , in 24 minutes . The Celtics will get a bit of a rest before hosting Minnesota on Monday . They will need to get back in the win column to stay competitive in the over - crowded East . The Hawks will have to stay on their A-game as they head to Orlando to face - off against the gritty Magic on Sunday ."
12,March,2015,Thursday,2014,AT&T Center,San Antonio,California,18600,18400,975,"The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 42 - 25 ) defeated the San Antonio Spurs ( 40 - 24 ) , 128 - 125 in a thriller on Thursday at the AT & T Center . When Tony Parker sunk a mid - range jumper to put the Spurs up six with just over 30 seconds remaining , it looked like the final nail in the Cavaliers ' coffin . Kyrie Irving then answered with two three - pointers , including a buzzer - beater , to send it into overtime . The Cavaliers needed every bit of Irving 's 16 fourth quarter points to force the extra frame , and he did n't stop there . He was a perfect 7 - for - 7 from beyond the arc on his way to a career - high 57 points . 27 of Irving 's points came in the fourth quarter and overtime as he led Cleveland back to an improbable win in San Antonio . The Spurs had n't lost in March since 2013 . The Cavaliers notched a signature win on the road Thursday thanks to Kyrie Irving 's unbelievable individual effort . LeBron James ' 31 points , seven assists , and five rebounds were crucial as well as he and Irving accounted for over two - thirds of Cleveland 's points . Kevin Love had a quiet night with just eight points and five rebounds after posting two consecutive double - doubles . The Cavaliers have a couple days off after Thursday 's marathon before returning to action Sunday in Orlando . The Spurs rarely end up on the losing end when they have a 10 - point lead in the fourth quarter , but it happened Thursday night to snap their six game winning streak . It 's even more rare when you consider that the Spurs shot 56 percent from the floor . Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard had tremendous outings with 31 and 24 points respectively , but Kyrie Irving and the Cavaliers proved to be too much in the end . Kawhi Leonard had two rare misses at the free throw line to give the Cavaliers a chance at the end of the fourth . The Spurs are off until Sunday when they host the Timberwolves ."

Golden State , which led by seven at halftime , broke the game open in the third quarter , outscoring Los Angeles 30 - 18 in the period . Stephen Curry spurred a 9 - 2 run in the middle of the quarter punctuated by a jaw - dropping play in which he weaved through four Clippers defenders before splashing in a long , pull - up three - pointer with nine seconds left on the shot clock . The basket put the Warriors up 13 points , and the lead swelled to 16 on the next possession when Draymond Green put in a running layup plus the foul . The Clippers trailed by 19 entering the fourth quarter but went on a 16 - 5 run late in the period , slicing the deficit to just eight with a minute to play . They 'd be held scoreless the rest of the way , however , losing for the second time in a row after falling to the Trail Blazers in overtime Wednesday night .

Green paced Golden State with 23 points and six rebounds , while Klay Thompson chipped in 21 points , including three three - pointers .

In 29 minutes he put up 24 points , six assists , five rebounds and two steals against in Boston . As is the case on most nights recently , Michael Carter-Williams had a rough shooting night , coupled with a high turnover rate . He had eight points of 3 - for - 8 shooting to go along with a whopping six turnovers on Friday . However he was able to contribute in other areas to help lead his team back to a .500 record . He finished with seven assists , five rebounds , five steals and two blocks . Much like the Bucks , the Celtics have a high - scoring sixth man off the bench who lead them in points . Isaiah Thomas had 23 points and six assists in 26 minutes , but did turn the ball over five times . Evan Turner had three turnovers himself ; he followed up his triple - double on Wednesday with a six points , six rebounds and six assists in a not so heavenly performance . Boston is trying to scratch and claw their way to a playoff birth but currently sit on the outside looking in at the Eastern Conference playoff picture .

This was a one - point game going into the final quarter , but the Raptors pulled away by winning the fourth quarter 28 - 18 in a defensive showcase . The biggest differential in the stat line was that the Raptors outscored the Mavericks in the paint 44 - 30 . With the Raptors ' strength being their backcourt , it was not a huge surprise to see the Mavericks struggle to contain Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan in this matchup , as both scored over 20 points in the victory . The Raptors added to one of their best starts in franchise history by limiting Dallas to 38 percent shooting from the field . The Raptors also outrebounded their opponent for a fourth straight game , and look poised to battle for the top spot in the Eastern Conference this season yet again . They have now won their four games by a combined 47 points and have three straight double - digit victories . Toronto , who was powered by double - doubles from Kyle Lowry and Luis Scola , will have a tough task trying to remain undefeated when they complete a back - to - back in Oklahoma City on Wednesday against the Thunder ( 3 - 1 ) . The Mavericks struggled to find their shot in this game , as the Raptors smothered them defensively . Dallas was led by Dirk Nowitzki , who finished with 18 points and seven rebounds in the loss . Forward Chandler Pasrsons played just 14 minutes in this game , as he is still working back to get to full strength after knee surgery in the summer . Now that Parsons , Deron Williams , and Wesley Matthews are all on the floor and healthy , the Mavericks look much more promising than they did a few weeks ago . They 'll look to bounce - back against the Charlotte Hornets ( 1 - 3 ) on Thursday ."

Starting in place of Steven Adams , who recently had surgery on his fractured hand , Kendrick Perkins played 20 minutes , recording four points and two rebounds . Mitch McGary followed up his 19 - point , 10 - rebound performance from Sunday with 17 points and 10 rebounds . He did n't play more than 25 minutes in either game but could be a force going forward with Perkins underproducing and Adams out for a few weeks . The Nuggets are slipping fast . They are 1 - 13 since winning five straight in early January . Kenneth Faried put up 22 points and 10 rebounds , but it was n't nearly enough to overcome Durant 's hot shooting night . Jusuf Nurkic had 16 points , 14 rebounds and two steals . Denver was without JaVale McGee ( illness ) and Jameer Nelson ( Achilles ) , who were both questionable going into Monday 's game . The Nuggets are now nine - and - a - half games back from the final playoff spot in the Western Conference .

Despite being down 38 - 26 after the first quarter , the Pacers made a statement in the second , out - scoring the Warriors 34 - 19 to finish the half . After taking the lead in the second , they were able to hold on throughout the rest of the game and secure the win over an extremely tough opponent in front of their home crowd . The Pacers were the superior shooters in this one , going 48 percent from the field and 42 percent from the three - point line , while the Warriors went just 38 percent from the floor and 35 percent from deep . The Pacers ' saw a huge contribution from their bench Sunday , with 63 of their 106 points coming off the bench . Rodney Stuckey led that charge , going 11 - for - 17 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 30 points , while also adding five assists . He 's come out of the All-Star break on fire , recording two 30 - point games in a row , as he 's been a huge reason for the Pacers recent success . C.J . Watson was another one of those bench players who got hot and finished with 14 points ( 4 - 6 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 5 - 6 FT ) and five assists in 26 minutes . He had failed to reach double figures in three straight games prior to Sunday , so it was good to see him get back on track . For the starters , George Hill and C.J . Miles were the only relatively effective players . Miles posted 13 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 3 - 6 3Pt ) and nine rebounds , including a clutch three - pointer to put the Pacers up four points with less than a minute left in the game , while Hill added 12 points ( 4 - 13 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) and a pair of assists . The Pacers ' guards did all the work in this one , and it paid off with a win . Quite uncharacteristicly , the Warriors struggled to get going , with only two players reaching double - digits in points . With Stephen Curry sitting out , Klay Thompson did far - and - away the most damage for the Warriors , finishing with a game - high of 39 points , as he went 12 - for - 28 from the field and 5 - for - 13 from the three - point line . He also was able to get to the free throw line 10 times , converting on a perfect 10 - of - 10 . He 's played well since returning from the All-Star break , combining for 59 points over his last two games . Andre Iguodala was the only other significant offensive contributor , posting 14 points ( 4 - 11 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and four assists in 32 minutes off the bench . It was his second straight game with 14 points , despite averaging only 7 points per game on the season . Also off the bench , David Lee chipped in with six points and 12 rebounds . The Warriors ' next game will be on the road against the Washington Wizards on Tuesday , while the Pacers will travel to Oklahoma City to play the Thunder on Tuesday ."

These teams continue to go in opposite directions , as the Hornets have now won five in a row , while the Pistons have brought their losing streak to six in a row . With the win , the Hornets have surprisingly pushed themselves to the seventh spot in the Eastern Conference standings , a half game above both the Pacers and Heat . The Hornets were the superior shooters in this one , going 52 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three - point line , while the Pistons finished at 44 percent from the floor and just 21 percent from deep . The Hornets were led by Al Jefferson , who scored a team - high of 24 points ( 10 - 14 FG , 4 - 6 FT ) , while adding eight rebounds and three assists in 30 minutes . Jefferson has been the model of consistency for this team , as he 's now averaged 22 points and 11 rebounds over his last four games . Jefferson received some help from Mo Williams though , who finished with 21 points ( 6 - 15 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 8 - 8 FT ) and nine assists in 37 minutes . Since coming over from the Timberwolves at the trade deadline , he 's been a fantastic pick - up and is averaging 22 points and 9 rebounds over nine games with the Hornets . Gerald Henderson came close to a triple - double , as he posted 13 points ( 5 - 12 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , six rebounds and nine assists . The nine assists matched a season - high for him , while he 's picked up his scoring of late and is averaging 17 points over his last four games . Cody Zeller pitched in with 11 points ( 4 - 5 FG , 3 - 3 FT ) and seven rebounds as well . Reggie Jackson may finally be getting comfortable with his new team , as he posted arguably his best game with the Pistons since coming over from the Thunder at the trade deadline . He went 9 - for - 21 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 25 points , while also adding seven rebounds and seven assists . In seven games since joining the Pistons , he 's averaging 17 points , 5 rebounds and 7 assists per game . Greg Monroe also did his best to keep the Pistons close , recording 18 points ( 7 - 11 FG , 4 - 6 FT ) , 11 rebounds and four assists . The double - double marked his sixth over his last seven games , as he 's now averaging a double - double on the season . Playing just 23 minutes , Andre Drummond was efficient with his time and posted 16 points ( 7 - 13 FG , 2 - 4 FT ) , five rebounds and two blocked shots . He usually plays in the mid - thirties for minutes , but the Pistons gave him some rest with a lighter work load on Sunday . The Hornets ' next game will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Monday , while the Pistons will travel to Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Tuesday ."
15,December,2015,Tuesday,2015,Staples Center,Los Angeles,California,19000,19000,1771,"The Los Angeles Lakers ( 4 - 21 ) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks ( 10 - 16 ) 113 - 95 on Tuesday . After Milwaukee beat the undefeated Golden State Warriors in their most recent game , fans hoped they came out of their slump . Clearly not , as the Lakers handled them here in a blowout win . The Lakers had a 20 - point lead after three quarters and this game was well out of hand before the final buzzer . The rebounding was the big difference , as the Lakers grabbed 52 to Milwaukee 's 38 . The free - throw shooting was a huge disparity as well , as the Lakers hit 21 - of - 25 while the Bucks went just 11 - for - 20 . Milwaukee was coming off one of their biggest wins in team history , but it does n't matter much anymore after losing to a four - win Lakers team . They still want 1 - 1 in those two games like everyone expected and that win means almost nothing now . This team continues to play poorly on both ends and there does n't seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel . Michael Carter-Williams was the lone bright spot in this game , as he tallied 19 points , five rebounds and five assists off the bench . They did have to play this game without Greg Monroe and that left them with very little post presence . Monroe missed the game due to some knee soreness and his status is up in the air for Milwaukee 's next game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday . The Lakers have been struggling mightily all season , but this was a great all - around performance . Seven players scored in double - figures with Kobe Bryant leading the team with 22 points . The bench was espcially good , as youngsters Julius Randle and D'Angelo Russell both played well here . Randle recorded a 14 point - 14 rebound double - double , while Russell amassed 19 points , seven assists and four rebounds . It 's rare to see this Lakers team hit on all cylinders like this , but it 's a good sight for Los Angeles fans . They 'll look to build off this rare win , when they take in the Houston Rockets on Thursday in their next scheduled game ."

Because both teams have already been eliminated from the playoffs , this gave each coaching staff another shot at evaluating talent for next season . It also cemented the Lakers into having the fourth worst record in the league , which means they 'll have the fourth best odds at getting the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft . The Kings dominated this game , as they went 55 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three - point line , while the Lakers finished at 38 percent from the floor and 29 percent from deep . It was the duo of Ben McLemore and Derrick Williams that helped lead the Kings to such a large victory . McLemore posted 24 points ( 9 - 18 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , five rebounds and seven assists , while Williams recorded 22 points ( 9 - 16 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) and six rebounds off the bench . McLemore has been very inconsistent all season long , so it was good to see him at least end with a strong performance . Williams also finished on a high note , as he combined for 42 points and seven rebounds over his final two outings . Ray McCallum chipped in with 19 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 5 - 9 FT ) and six assists , while Nik Stauskas was in the starting lineup and posted 14 points ( 5 - 9 FG , 3 - 4 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and five assists . The Lakers were led by a huge performance from Jabari Brown . Brown went 9 - for - 19 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 32 points , while also adding three rebounds . He 's been one of the few bright spots here at the end of the season for the Lakers , as he 's averaged 22 points over his final four games . He 'll likely find himself a role somewhere next season after showing what he can do on the court this year . Vander Blue also had a solid showing , finishing with 15 points ( 6 - 23 FG , 1 - 8 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) , seven rebounds and eight assists . With so many injuries in the backcourt , the second - year guard played the whole game Wednesday and took advantage , posting career - highs in points , rebounds and assists in just his second game for the Lakers this season . Jordan Hill added 12 points ( 5 - 14 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and six rebounds as well . With both teams missing the playoffs , this marks the end of their respective seasons ."

In a game between two teams fighting for one of the last playoff spots in the East , Detroit dominated the third quarter to give the Pistons a decisive advantage . The Pistons entered the game ranked 21st in the league in scoring , but that was n't evident as they were able to top 100 points for the fifth time in six games . Detroit did n't only have an excellent offensive showing , it also played suffocating defense , holding Charlotte under 80 points . With Tuesday 's victory , Detroit has now won four of its last six games . The Pistons got another big game from Greg Monroe , who finished with 23 points and 12 rebounds for another double - double . Detroit will host San Antonio on Wednesday before heading into the All-Star Break . Charlotte had quietly been playing very well of late , but dropped its third straight game Tuesday . The Hornets were missing Michael Kidd-Gilchrist again , as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury he suffered Saturday against Philadelphia . On the bright side , P.J Hairston had a career - high 16 points in 26 minutes on the floor . The Hornets head into the All-Star break sitting in the eighth spot in the East ."

Kobe Bryant was far from his vintage self , scoring only two points in the second half of the game , and finished with 19 points , three assists and one rebound on 7 - of - 22 shooting . Bryant and Thunder forward Kevin Durant looked to be enjoying their matchup , but Durant got the better of five time NBA champion in the blowout win . The Lakers were without sophomore forward Julius Randle ( ankle ) and started Larry Nance Jr in his place . Nance contributed a lowly four points and five rebounds in the losing effort . Rookie point guard D'Angelo Russell added 18 points off the bench and outscored starting guard Jordan Clarkson , who finished with 10 points , six rebounds and two assists . The Lakers shot their way out of the game from the very beginning of the second half , completing just 36 percent of their field goals and going 7 - of - 25 from the 3 - point line . The Thunder were led by Russell Westbrook , who threw down two highlight worthy dunks on his way to 23 points , eight rebounds and eight assists .

The Grizzlies badly needed a slump buster , as they had lost three straight in a tough stretch of their schedule against the Cavaliers , Warriors and Spurs coming into Monday . That 's just what they got in the form of the DeMarcus Cousin-less Sacramento Kings . Marc Gasol did n't have a field day scoring the ball as Reggie Evans , who stepped in for Cousins , is a bothersome defender . Instead Gasol was able to find passing lanes that led to baskets as he finished with six assists , leading his team in that category from the center position . Memphis is elated that March is over , as they piled up eight losses , making it their worst month of the season . Former Memphis star Rudy Gay did his best to pick up the slack for Cousins . Gay put up 24 points in 29 minutes but left the game in the third quarter after being elbowed by Gasol . He did n't return as he was suffering from concussion like symptoms . The Kings went into the final period down 11 and with their go - to scorer . They were unable to muster enough points to surpass the Grizzlies and garnered their second straight loss after a four - game win streak . The Houston Rockets will welcome the Kings to town on Wednesday , as Memphis will bring in the Oklahoma City Thunder ."

Utah took the lead with 7:30 left in the fourth quarter after an 11 - 2 run but that is when Stephen Curry and the Warriors kicked it into another gear . Curry seemed to have an answer for almost every Utah bucket and when he missed a contested lay - up in the last minutes Draymond Green was there to clean up the mess . Derrick Favors had a great game for the Jazz and was clutch in the last few minutes . He finished with 23 points on 9 - 15 shooting , including 5 - 5 free throws , 10 rebounds , two assists and two steals . Gordon Hayward also performed well , totalling a team - high 24 points , along with six assists and four rebounds , in 37 minutes .

Alec Burks was big 28 minutes off the bench , with 19 points on 8 - 15 shooting , two rebounds , two assists and two steals . The Warriors were forced to play this one right down to the wire and would have lost if Utah had hit their last second open shot attempt . Stephen Curry led the way in scoring for Golden State with 26 points on 9 - 20 shooting , 4 - 8 from downtown , six rebounds , five assists and two steals . Draymond Green contributed in many ways including 20 points , nine rebounds , seven assists and immeasurable hustle and energy .
