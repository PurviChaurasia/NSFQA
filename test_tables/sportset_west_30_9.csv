The Nuggets pulled off an unlikely feat Tuesday , by beating the Lakers for the fifth straight game at the Staples Center . That probably says more about where the Lakers are at this point more than the Nuggets , as the Lakers are still winless a week into the season . The referees may need to get new whistles after this game as well , as there were 53 combined fouls and 69 combined free - throw attempts Tuesday .
