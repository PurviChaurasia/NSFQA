27,March,2015,Friday,2014,AT&T Center,San Antonio,California,18600,18400,979,"The San Antonio Spurs ( 46 - 26 ) beat the Dallas Mavericks ( 45 - 28 ) 94 - 76 on Friday . The Spurs won the first and fourth quarters by 10 points each , and the held the Mavs to limited productivity in between . Boris Diaw was the man for San Antonio in the game , he went 3 - for - 4 on three pointers for a game - high 19 points . San Antonio is 10 - 3 in March and seems to be playing their best basketball of the season when it matters most . Well you wo n't read this statement too often but Tyson Chandler led the Mavericks in points . Believe it or not it 's true , he and Monta Ellis put in 10 points a piece , but it was n't nearly enough to take down the defending champs on their home floor . It never helps when you only shoot 22 percent from beyond the arc . The Mavericks will look to bounce back on Sunday when they take on the Indiana Pacers , as the Spurs will host the Memphis Grizzlies who were annihilated by the Golden State Warriors on Friday ."
3,March,2015,Tuesday,2014,Madison Square Garden,New York City,New York,19800,19800,522,"The Sacramento Kings ( 21 - 37 ) defeated the New York Knicks ( 12 - 47 ) 124 - 86 on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden in New York . The Kings dominated this game offensively right from the beginning , out - scoring the Knicks 65 - 39 by half , and reaching the 100 - point mark after just the third quarter . Their superior shooting was a big reason for this , as they went 49 percent from the field and 56 percent from the three - point line , while the Knicks finished at 37 percent from the floor and just 18 percent from deep . Along with that , the Kings also secured a 46 - 38 rebounding advantage , only furthering their impressive performance Tuesday .

Rudy Gay led the way , going 9 - for - 15 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 25 points , to go along with seven rebounds and four assists in just 26 minutes . He 's now shot 40 percent or higher in each of his last four games , a span where he 's averaging 23 points and 7 rebounds . DeMarcus Cousins also was a big factor in the win , finishing with 22 points ( 5 - 10 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 11 - 11 FT ) , 10 rebounds and two blocked shots . Like Gay , he 's been a beast lately , averaging 24 points and 11 rebounds over his last five games . Both players could have put up some even higher numbers in this matchup , but because of the blowout , they were each held to less than 30 minutes on the court . Ben McLemore was also very efficient with his time , scoring 20 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) in just 23 minutes . He 's picked up his game of late , recording two 20 - point games over his last three , despite averaging just 12 points on the season . Coming off the bench , Derrick Williams and Nik Stauskas reached double figures as well with 17 and 15 points respectively . As shown by their final score , the Knicks struggled to get much going Tuesday , including having all five of their starters combine for just 24 points . With that being said , they did see some solid contributions off their bench . Alexey Shved led the team in scoring , posting 15 points ( 4 - 11 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 7 - 9 FT ) , to go along with seven rebounds and three assists in 32 minutes . It was a season - high in minutes for the guard , as he took advantage of the extra time with his second 15 - point showing in a row . Shane Larkin was also one of those bench players who provided some points . He went 5 - for - 9 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from the three - point line to finish with 13 points , while adding six assists and two steals as well . It was just the sixth time all season that he finished in double - digit points .

3,April,2015,Friday,2014,United Center,Chicago,Illinois,22100,20900,121,"The Chicago Bulls ( 46 - 30 ) beat the Detroit Pistons ( 29 - 47 ) 88 - 82 on Friday . Pau Gasol led the Bulls in a solid team effort against Detroit . His team held the Pistons to just nine points in the second quarter but could n't quite hold them off , as they were able to make a run on the Bulls late . Gasol had 26 points , 10 rebounds and one block , and his teammate Joakim Noah put on a passing display from the center position with ten assists . Jimmy Butler put another nice game together , as he is very likely to receive a huge payday this summer . Derrick Rose and Kirk Hinrich were both ruled out for Friday 's tilt , as they are recovering from knee injuries . The Bull 's production at point guard suffered with E'Twaun Moore and Aaron Brooks combining for just ten points on 4 - of - 16 shooting from the field to go along with three assists in 48 minutes played . Chicago has locked up a playoff spot but still is still looking to improve their seed with just a couple weeks remaining in the season . Andre Drummond has solidified himself as a dominant force in the NBA this season . Even against a stout Chicago defense he was able to record 14 points , 22 rebounds and six blocks before fouling out after 43 minutes of action . Over his past five he 's averaged 19 points , 13 rebounds , 2 blocks and 1 steals a game . His new point guard Reggie Jackson has been a great addition for the Pistons . He put up a nice game on Friday with 22 points and nine assists , but was bit by the turnover bug , as he recorded eight of them . The Bulls only had ten total turnovers as a team . Detroit has not been mathematically eliminated from the playoffs and will have to make a strong run the rest of the way if they want to take one of the final spots in the Eastern Conference . The Hornets , Pacers and Celtics all would not make the playoffs if they began tomorrow . Each of them has better records than the Pistons . Detroit will head home for Saturday 's game with the Miami Heat , who currently holds the eighth seed that the Pistons so desperately covet . The Bulls will have a day off to gear up for their big game with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday ."
25,November,2015,Wednesday,2015,Amway Center,Orlando,Florida,18800,18800,1812,"The Orlando Magic ( 7 - 8 ) defeated the New York Knicks ( 8 - 8 ) 100 - 91 on Wednesday . The Magic and Knicks played a very strange game on Wednesday , as both teams shot terribly , but did n't make many mistakes . In fact , Both teams shot below 40 percent from the field and the two teams combined for just 18 turnovers . Defense was clearly the focus for both teams , as the Knicks failed to record a fast - break point all game long . There were very little differences in the stat sheet and it simply came down to the fact that the Magic 's bench signicantly outplayed the Knicks bench . Orlando got 43 bench points to the Knicks 12 and that proved to be the difference . The Knicks came into this game as one of the hottest teams in the league , but struggled offensively in this matchup . This Scott Skiles defense stifled the Knicks , despite the fact that Carmelo Anthony and Jose Calderon scored season - highs in points . Anthony had his best game of the season statistically speaking , as he tallied 28 points and 13 rebounds in the loss . Calderon also had his best game in years , as he totaled 25 points , four assists and three rebounds in the defeat . It was the `` others `` who killed this team though , as no other player scored more than 10 points in the loss . It 's clear that this team plays better when Anthony takes less shots and that was the fact yet again on Wednesday . The Knicks will play the Miami Heat on Friday in their next scheduled game . The Magic made a strange move by relegating Victor Oladipo to the bench , but that proved to work wonders here . It 's unclear if it lit a fire under him or that he just played better in the second unit , but Oladipo had one of his best games of the season in that role . Oladipo scored a team - high 24 points off the bench and did that damage in just 26 minutes of action . Tobias Harris , Nikola Vucevic and Elfrid Payton all recorded double - doubles as well , and this was one of the best all - around team efforts the Magic have had all season . Orlando will look to play like this again when they take on the struggling Milwaukee Bucks on Friday ."

Both teams came into this game injury - riddled and on the second night of a back - to - back . The Blazers were riding a three - game winning streak and a win could have got them all tied up with the Jazz for the eighth spot in the West . However , the Jazz managed to muster up some offense and retain their superior position in the standings . Trey Burke picked up the slack in a huge way for the Jazz , who were missing Derrick Favors ( back spasms ) , Rudy Gobert ( MCL strain ) and Alec Burks ( fractured fibula ) . Burke dropped a hot 27 points on 12 - 19 shooting from the field , in 29 minutes off the bench . Gordon Hayward chipped in 23 points ( 8 - 19 FG , 4 - 12 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) , along with 10 rebounds , one assist and one steal , in 33 minutes . Rodney Hood contributed a complete game with 18 points , seven rebounds and six assists , in 29 minutes . The Jazz shot 50 percent from the field and kept the turnovers to a minimum , with only six . Damian Lillard sat this one out , making it six games that he has missed due to plantar fasciitis . C.J . McCollum has been playing well and was at it again in this one , as he finished with a game - high 32 points ( 13 - 26 FG , 6 - 11 3Pt ) , along with seven rebounds and six assists , in 40 long minutes . Meyers Leonard was strong in 33 minutes off the bench . Leonard finished with 17 points , three rebounds and two assists .

Next the Trail Blazers will head to Denver for a game on Sunday . That will be another important division match - up for Portland , as the Nuggets are just one game behind them in the standings . The Jazz will host the Grizzlies on Saturday ."
24,November,2015,Tuesday,2015,FedExForum,Memphis,Tennessee,17400,17800,1483,"The Memphis Grizzlies ( 8 - 7 ) defeated the Dallas Mavericks ( 9 - 6 ) 110 - 96 on Tuesday . The Mavericks outplayed the Grizzlies in several categories , yet curiously still came up well short of a victory . Dallas drained 11 three - pointers to Memphis ' seven , and the Mavs also outrebounded the home team 48 to 42 . Zaza Pachulia 's performance particularly stood out in this regard , as he held his own against one of the best all - around centers in the game in Marc Gasol . Pachulia went toe - to - toe on the glass with the Grizzlies ' big man , matching his 10 boards while also collecting 13 points . Veteran Dirk Nowitzki posted a double - double of his own , his second on the season . The veteran power forward totaled 14 points and 10 rebounds , while adding a block and a steal . Deron Williams ( 10 points ) and Wesley Matthews ( 11 points ) made respectable contributions , with the latter draining three three - pointers , giving him seven over the last two contests . Reserves J.J. Barea and Raymond Felton paced the Dallas bench with a pair of 16 - point outings . Felton was notably perfect on three - pointers , draining all four of his shots from beyond the arc . The Mavericks fell to 9 - 6 and currently reside in second place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They travel to San Antonio for a Wednesday tilt versus the Spurs . The Grizzlies received a remarkably balanced offensive performance from their starters , something they have significantly lacked in many games this season . Gasol collected 15 points and the aforementioned 10 boards , while point guard Mike Conley continued his recent stretch of resurgent play on offense . The veteran tallied 21 points , six assists , and four rebounds , for his fourth game of 20 points or more in the last five contests . Matt Barnes parlayed his rare starting opportunity into a solid tally of 14 points , seven rebounds , three assists and a pair of steals over 38 minutes . Jeff Green acquitted himself well filling in at power forward for the ailing Zach Randolph ( knee ) , pitching in 19 points , seven rebounds , three assists and a pair of blocks in a tough matchup against Nowitzki . Mario Chalmers led the Memphis reserves with 14 points , while JaMychal Green made the most of his return to the bench by amassing 13 points over just 17 minutes . The Grizzlies improved to 8 - 7 and currently reside in third place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head to Houston for a Wednesday showdown versus the Rockets ."
28,February,2015,Saturday,2014,US Airways Center,Phoenix,Arizona,18100,18100,1014,"The San Antonio Spurs ( 36 - 23 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 31 - 29 ) , 101 - 74 .

With the score tied 86 - 86 after the third quarter , Nets coach Lionel Hollins decided to roll with a small lineup featuring Shane Larkin , Jarrett Jack , Markel Brown and Joe Johnson . It backfired , as the Hornets were able to take an eight - point lead and would eventually hold on for the win . Nic Batum led the way for Charlotte , scoring 24 points ( 7 - 12 FG , 3 - 6 3Pt , 7 - 7 FT ) while matching his season high of eight assists . Brooklyn had a chance to win its second straight game , but instead fell further behind in the Eastern Conference standings . Perhaps the difference in the game was the rebounding battle , which the Nets lost 49 to 37 while playing mediocre defense after holding the Hawks to 88 points in Tuesday 's win . Brook Lopez was limited to just five rebounds , shooting 8 - of - 19 from the floor before fouling out in the fourth quarter . Thad Young , who posted a season - high 27 points ( 11 - 17 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 5 - 6 FT ) , scored 15 of his 27 in the third quarter to keep the Hornets from running away with the game . Jack nearly finished with a triple - double , pouring in 16 points with nine assists and eight rebounds over 33 minutes . Charlotte got contributions from everywhere Wednesday night , as seven players finished with double - digit scoring .

Lin came off the bench and scored 13 points over a season - high 29 minutes , pulling down nine rebounds and dishing out four assists for perhaps his most productive game of the season .

The Jazz continued their strong play of late , recording their second straight win and seventh of their last ten . Despite the loss , the Nets actually were the superior shooters in this one , going 50 percent from the field and 53 percent from the three - point line , while the Jazz finished at 47 percent from the floor and 46 percent from deep . What may have been the deciding factor were free throws though . The Jazz converted on 17 - of - 21 , while the Nets shot just 11 and converted on only four of those 11 attempts . As has been the case for the Jazz all season , both Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors did the bulk of the work offensively . Hayward finished with a team - high of 24 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 8 - 9 FT ) , while adding five rebounds and three steals as well . It was his second impressive performance in a row , as he 's combined for 49 points , 14 rebounds , five assists and four steals over his last two . He 's now averaging 20 points and 5 rebounds on the year . Favors , on the other hand , posted 22 points ( 8 - 16 FG , 6 - 8 FT ) , eight rebounds and four assists in 37 minutes . He 's also played very well of late , averaging 19 points and 7 rebounds over his last four games . Rookie Dante Exum had one of the better games of his career , notching double figures in points for just the seventh time this season and first since the end of January . He went 5 - for - 6 from the field and a perfect 4 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 14 points , while adding four assists as well . The only other Jazz player to reach double - digit points was Trey Burke , who came off the bench for 12 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt ) and four assists in 20 minutes . The Nets really struggled to score in this one , with just three players reaching double figures in points . One of those players was Brook Lopez , who took over the starting center spot for Mason Plumlee , as Plumlee was put back into a bench role . In 35 minutes , Lopez scored 19 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 3 - 5 FT ) , to go along with 10 rebounds and two blocked shots . It was his second double - double in a row , as he 's combined for 38 points and 23 rebounds over that span . He 's now averaging 16 points and 7 rebounds on the season . Along with Lopez , Thaddeus Young also moved into the starting lineup Sunday , pushing Alan Anderson to the bench . He matched a team - high with 19 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt ) , while also adding three rebounds and four steals in 32 minutes . With such a strong performance , he should continue to start for the forseeable future . Coming off the bench , Bojan Bogdanovic added 11 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 3 - 4 3Pt ) in 21 minutes . Both Joe Johnson and Deron Williams struggled in this one , scoring nine and six points respectively .

They say that familiarity breeds contempt , and though these two teams had n't met this season until Monday , two games in a span of four days caused things to get chippy Thursday at the Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte . The game was physical throughout , most notably when John Wall knocked Brian Roberts to the floor on a hard screen in the first half . Tensions boiled over in the fourth when Cody Zeller and Nene Hilario got tangled up , drawing a double technical . The Wizards recent free fall continued and to make things worse , Bradley Beal left the game after 11 minutes with a toe injury . Washington has now dropped five in a row , including two this week to Charlotte . The Wizards got another great showing from John Wall , who finished with 15 points and 13 rebounds while Paul Pierce led the team in scoring with 19 points . Washington 's losing streak has caused it to lose ground in the East and is at risk of being tied by Cleveland depending on how the Cavaliers ' game ends later Thursday evening . The Wizards will look to snap their losing streak Saturday when they host the Nets . Charlotte is quietly one of the hottest teams in the East right now , having won three in a row and seven of its last ten . Brian Roberts was able to return to the game after being shaken up on the aforementioned pick by Wall and finished with 12 points . Even in Bismack Biyombo 's absence , the Hornets were able to out - rebound the Wizards 50 - 37 . The Hornets will return to action Saturday in Philadelphia ."

Middleton was continually called upon for late - game heroics during the 2014 - 15 season , so Milwaukee was very happy to see the swingman return to form again Wednesday .

Marreese Speights added 17 points ( 8 - 13 FG , 1 - 2 FT ) of his own , to go along with eight rebounds and three assists .

The Timberwolves did secure a 47 - 43 rebounding advantage , but it was n't enough to take down the Mavericks . Monta Ellis had the most production for the Mavericks , finishing with 23 points ( 7 - 21 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt , 6 - 11 FT ) , two assists and two steals in 36 minutes . He 's had two impressive games in a row , combining for 48 points , 15 assists and five steals over that span . Chandler Parsons was also extremely effective , as he had his shot dialed in . He went 8 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 18 points , while also adding six rebounds and four steals . The four steals were a new season - high for him , as he was productive on both sides of the ball Monday . Dirk Nowitzki was very efficient in his time on the floor , scoring 16 points ( 7 - 10 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 0 - 1 FT ) and grabbing seven rebounds . He 's scored 14 points or less in each of his last four games , so it was good to see him start trending back towards his season - average of 18 points per game . Starting in place of Rajon Rondo , Jose Barea added 10 points ( 4 - 14 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and eight assists . In his fourth game back since returning from his lengthy wrist injury , Kevin Martin scored a team - high of 19 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) in 38 minutes .

Thaddeus Young nearly recorded a double - double , posting 15 points ( 5 - 10 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 5 - 6 FT ) , nine rebounds and three steals . He 's turned it on during his last two games , combining for 34 points and 12 rebounds . Andrew Wiggins did n't necessarily have his best showing from the field , finishing only 4 - of - 14 from the floor to score 14 points . He just posted 33 points on Saturday , so it was somewhat of a letdown for him . The biggest storyline of the night for the Timberwolves though was the return of Ricky Rubio . He moved right back into the starting lineup and posted 10 points ( 4 - 9 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , three rebounds and four assists in only 21 minutes . It was expected he 'd be on a minutes restriction , so it 's no surprise he played such a small portion of time . Mo Williams added 15 points ( 3 - 7 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 7 - 7 FT ) and five assists off the bench as well .

The Raptors had a big lead early in the fourth quarter and nearly blew it against the Dallas backups . They were able to hold them off , but it was an ugly sight for Toronto fans as they nearly let a 16 - point fourth quarter lead slip away . A win is a win though and the defense was key . The Raptors outrebounded the Mavericks 53 - 34 and held them to just 35 percent shooting through the first three and a half quarters . The starters dominated this game all - around , as only one bench player scored in double - figures for both teams . The Mavericks were bad for most of the game tonight and played well for only 18 minutes . They shot 11 - for - 17 in a 31 - point third quarter , but shot under 42 percent aside from that . The bench players came in for the last six minutes and nearly brought them back from a double - digit deficit , but could n't quite make up for the starters poor play . While The Mavericks did win the turnover battle 17 - 6 , they were killed on the boards . Dirk Nowitzki played just 28 minutes , but tallied 20 points and seven rebounds . Deron Williams left this game in the third with a hamstring injury and that really hurt the team down the stretch . The starters got a nice rest in the final quarter and that should be beneficial for Wednesday 's game against the Brooklyn Nets . All the talk in Toronto has been about their bad starts , but that was n't the problem on Tuesday . They actually ended the first quarter up 32 - 16 and had trouble closing this one out . That 's usually the opposite , as they have one of the best second half differentials in the NBA this season . All the starters played well , as four of them scored at least 15 points with Bismack Biyombo scoring just nine . Biyombo was the star of the night though , as he snatched a career - high 20 rebounds en route to his fifth - straight 13 - plus rebound game . DeMar DeRozan led all scorers with 28 points in the victory . Toronto will have a few days off until they play the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday ."

It 's rare to see a team lose a turnover battle 19 - 12 and win a game , but that 's just what the Bulls did on Wednesday . Chicago shot just shy of 50 percent from the field while Phoenix shot just above 40 percent . The three - point shooting was the big difference though , as the Bulls went 9 - for - 19 while the Suns went 8 - for - 27 . Jimmy Butler was the hero in this game though , as he scored 14 points in the final 12 minutes . The Bulls played this game without an ailing Derrick Rose and did n't miss a beat . They went with a Kirk Hinrich-Aaron Brooks committee and that worked out well for Chicago as they combined for 26 points and 11 assists in the win . Butler was the star of the show though , as he tallied 32 points and six rebounds in the victory while playing a Tom Thibodeau-like 43 minutes . Brooks did end up leaving this game with a hamstring injury and they ca n't afford to lose any more guards at this point . Chicago 's next game should be a fun one , as they travel to Golden State to take on the undefeated Warriors on Friday . The Suns were down big early in this game and showed some perseverance to make it a close game at the end . It was the frontcourt once again that let down Phoenix , as Markieff Morris and Tyson Chandler combined for just 12 points in the loss . This is a trend that is becoming all too common for the Suns and they simply need more from these two , especially against teams like the Bulls . Brandon Knight led the team in scoring with 23 points , while Eric Bledsoe and P.J . Tucker each pitched in 20 - plus points of their own . This snapped a three - game winning streak for the Suns and they 'll look to start a new one on Friday against the Denver Nuggets ."
