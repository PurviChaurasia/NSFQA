Coming in with high expectations after missing the playoffs last year , the Heat did n't disappoint in their opener and pulled off the victory in front of their home crowd . Despite a slow start from the field , the Heat came up with a very big second quarter , out - scoring the Hornets 31 - 17 to take a 10 - point lead into the half . A seemingly even match the rest of the way , the Heat used their three - point shooting advantage ( 12 - 20 3Pt ) to give them enough of a spark to push them to a win . As expected , the Heat 's dynamic duo of Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade did most of the damage . Bosh recorded his first double - double of the year , posting 21 points ( 5 - 13 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt ) and 10 rebounds over 32 minutes . He continually abused the Hornets ' bigs , forcing his way to the free throw line 10 times , while cashing in on nine of those ten attempts . Wade , on the other hand , added 20 points ( 7 - 16 FG , 6 - 6 FT ) of his own , to go along with five assists . After averaging 22 points and 5 assists last season , it looks as if he 's picked up right where he left off . The big surprise of the night was Gerald Green 's play off the bench . After playing with the Suns last season , Green capped off his Heat debut with a bench - high of 19 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 5 - 8 3Pt ) , giving the Heat just enough of a boost to help propel them to a win . For the Hornets , it was Al Jefferson who did most of the work early . He dominated his way to 17 points at the half , but failed to contribute even a single point following that . While there was n't any reports of an injury , he finished with just 22 minutes of game action , so it 's still unclear why he played in such a limited fashion . Kemba Walker was the only other starter in the lineup to get things going offensively . He went 5 - for - 16 from the field and 8 - for - 9 from the free throw line to post 19 points , while also adding four assists and four rebounds . Making his Hornets ' debut , Jeremy Lin chipped in with 17 points ( 5 - 10 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 5 - 6 FT ) and a pair of assists off the bench .

The game brought Utah 's league - best 11 - game win streak to an end . Throughout its win streak , Utah ( 30 - 29 ) had been solid defensively , holding opponents to an average of just 98 points per game .

Rudy Gay scored a game - high 40 points in 36 minutes to lead the way for the Kings . New point guard Darren Collison followed up his impressive season debut with another great performance Friday , finishing with 17 points , eight rebounds , and eight assists in 38 minutes . The signing of Ramon Sessions before the start of training camp put the depth of Collison 's role in question , but if the first two games of the season are any indication , Collison should be part of the Kings ' core in tune with DeMarcus Cousins and Gay . Damian Lillard rebounded well from a subpar opener and finised with 20 points and seven rebounds in 35 minutes . LaMarcus Aldridge continued to show off his new three - point shot , coverting one 1 - of - 3 attempts from beyond the arc and finishing with 22 points in 38 minutes . Thomas Robinson has played just two minutes total this season and was not used at all in the Blazers ' second game , a dubious development following the team 's decision not to pickup Robinson 's 2014 - 15 option on his contract earlier this week .

14,November,2015,Saturday,2015,Staples Center,Los Angeles,California,19100,19000,1441,"The Los Angeles Clippers ( 6 - 4 ) took advantage of a 12 - minute dry spell from the Detroit Pistons ' ( 5 - 4 ) offense , coming back from a 17 - point deficit to win 101 - 96 . Los Angeles power forward Blake Griffin continued his dominant season , posting 34 points , eight rebounds , and nine assists , narrowly missing the triple - double . With point guard Chris Paul ( groin ) hindered by injury , Griffin has come in as the leader of the Clippers ' squad this season . Coming into Saturday 's contest , Griffin was posting season averages of 26 points , 9 rebounds , and 4 assists per game . The absence of Paul as well as shooting guard JJ Redick ( back ) allowed sixth man Jamal Crawford to slide into the starting lineup against Detroit . Crawford was electric , tallying 37 points and eight assists while shooting a perfect 10 - for - 10 from the line . While Griffin and Crawford looked dominant , the real turn of momentum occured in the second half , as the Clippers ' repeated fouling of Detroit center Andre Drummond forced coach Stan Van Gundy to pull him from the game . While Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers has been an outspoken opponent of the `` hack - a - player `` strategy , the technique worked in the Clippers ' favor on Saturday , effectively neutralizing the dominant Drummond . The 22 - year - old center 's play so far this season had earned him back - to - back Eastern Conference Player of the Week honors . Despite spending much of the final stretch on the bench , Drummond was able to record his ninth straight double - double , posting 18 points and 19 rebounds on the night . Saturday 's game brought Drummond to a total of 173 rebounds through his first nine games , making him the first player to do so since Kareem Abdul-Jabar . While Drummond provided a bright spot for the Pistons , the true story of the game was Detroit 's dismal third - quarter play . The Pistons were outscored 50 - 36 in the second half and were , at one point , kept from the basket for a full twelve minutes . Detroit will hope for a more consistent performance tomorrow as they prepare to play at the Staples Center again , this time against the Lakers . Meanwhile , the Clippers will enjoy a few days of rest as they prepare for a home game against the league - best Golden State Warriors on Thursday ."

Houston ( 23 - 4 ) has been a seemingly unstoppable force since superstar point guard Chris Paul made his return to the lineup in mid - November . The team not only holds the league 's best record , but also owns an NBA-best 12 - game win streak . The Rockets have yet to lose a game with Paul in the lineup . On Friday , the team showed why , cruising past the always - tough San Antonio Spurs thanks to 28 - point performances from both Paul and MVP contender James Harden . In addition to his explosive scoring output , Paul tallied eight assists and a season high of seven steals . Paul and Harden were key components of a dominant first quarter for Houston , as the team was able to hop out to a double - digit lead within the first 10 minutes of play . Houston never relinquished the lead , despite allowing 37 points in the fourth quarter . The Spurs hold the best record of any opponent yet beaten by Houston on their current win streak . San Antonio ( 19 - 10 ) still sits at third in the Western Conference , but was beaten handily on Friday night .

San Antonio trailed by five after an uninspired first half , but the team came out of the break with some fire . Tony Parker was instrumental in turning the game into a runaway , scoring the first eight points of the third quarter to spark a 28 - 11 run that flipped a five - point deficit into a 12 - point lead heading into the fourth . The Spurs would continue their dominance over the final 12 minutes to easily dispatch the Nets , relying on a rather balanced scoring attack to accomplish that feat . All five starters had between eight and 16 points , while coach Gregg Popovich used eight bench players , who combined for an impressive 43 points . What began as an encouraging start for the Nets resulted in a second consecutive 15 - point loss , putting the team in an early hole to begin the season . Brook Lopez led the team with 17 points on a respectable 6 - for - 11 from the field , but his inability to make an impact on the glass ( three rebounds ) was true for the rest of his teammates . The Spurs outrebounded the Nets by a 56 - 32 count . On a more fortunate note for Brooklyn , starting point guard Jarrett Jack was able to return to the court after missing the season opener with a hamstring injury . He turned in a solid showing , scoring 12 points to go along with seven assists and six rebounds over 27 minutes . The Nets will continue their road trip with a visit to Memphis on Saturday , while the Spurs will get a day off before squaring off with the Celtics in Boston on Sunday ."

Rookie James Michael-McAdoo went 6 - for - 10 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from the free throw line to score 16 points , to go along with five rebounds in 28 minutes . It was just his fifth game of the season , as he 's spent the majority of his time in the NBA D-League since being signed for the rest of the season by the Warriors in mid - February . It was a career - high in points for the guard . Leandro Barbosa chipped in with 14 points ( 5 - 13 FG , 3 - 4 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and nine assists as well .
