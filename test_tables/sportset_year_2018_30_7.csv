The Raptors ( 38 - 16 ) came into this game riding a three - game winning streak and had no problems to extend it four , since the Knicks ( 23 - 33 ) barely posed a threat offensively . The absence of Kristaps Porzingis was something New York could n't mask , and Toronto controlled the game right from the start . In fact , the Raptors jumped to a 23 - 18 lead after the first quarter and they never looked back , winning each quarter by at least five points on route to a comfortable 25 - point win . The loss extended New York 's losing streak to five contests . DeMar DeRozan ( eight points , 2 - 11 FG ) and Kyle Lowry ( seven points , 2 - 10 FG ) did n't have good performances , but the bench picked up the slack for the Raptors in this one since five second - unit players scored at least 10 points .

A 31 - 21 third quarter really made the difference for the Pacers , as they held the lead for the entirety of the fourth quarter .

The see - saw battle fittingly came down to the closing seconds , as the two clubs took their respective turns enjoying breakout quarters . The Pacers ( 29 - 23 ) were at their best during the middle periods after falling behind by a modest 25 - 21 margin in the first period .

Their edge was short - lived , however , and Memphis ' inability to convert on multiple shot attempts in the final minute - plus played a pivotal part in their failure to ever reclaim the lead . A Jarrell Martin personal foul with 34 seconds left led to two successful Myles Turner free throws , and after Selden was ejected for a technical foul with a second remaining following a Cory Joseph block of his layup attempt , Bojan Bogdanovic converted all three of his tries from the charity stripe for the final margin of victory . In addition to Selden 's aforementioned miss , Dillon Brooks and Marc Gasol failed to find the net on a combined three shots over the final 1:14 .

The Pistons ( 22 - 18 ) went into Wednesday 's contest looking to right the ship after having lost four of their previous six games , and they appeared to have a potentially soft target in a struggling Nets ( 15 - 26 ) squad . Brooklyn had the additional handicap of being without the services of DeMarre Carroll , who was sidelined with a knee injury . They kept matters competitive in the first quarter , but despite their best efforts , they still trailed 34 - 26 going into the second quarter . The situation quickly unraveled from there , as Detroit outscored the Nets by a 56 - 35 margin over the second and third quarters to essentially seal the win at that point .

10,December,2018,Monday,2018,Staples Center,Los Angeles,California,19000,19000,5468,"The Los Angeles Lakers escaped with a win over the visiting Miami Heat , 108 - 105 , at Staples Center on Monday evening . It was a hotly anticipated contest , as it likely marked the last time that LeBron James and Dwyane Wade , two friends and future Hall of Famers , would face each other . With Wade expected to retire at the end of the season , the Los Angeles crowd offered him a warm welcome . Unfortunately for Wade and the Heat ( 11 - 15 ) , they were unable to steal the game from LeBron and the Lakers ( 17 - 10 ) , who overcame a halftime deficit to win their sixth game in their last seven outings . Things got off to a mediocre start for the Lakers , as the team missed out on some early transition opportunities , including a missed layup for sophomore guard Lonzo Ball . Still , behind a near triple - double from James , the Lakers earned the win . LeBron scored 28 points to go with nine rebounds and 12 assists . Kyle Kuzma was the team 's leading scorer , complementing James ' strong offensive output with an additional 33 points . Wade earned a double - double in what was likely his last game at Staples Center . He finished with 15 points and 10 assists off the bench . His 6 - of - 19 shooting night , though , was emblematic of his team 's shaky overall offensive night . The Heat hit just 44 percent of its shots from the field in the loss and committed 17 turnovers . The Heat will visit Utah on Wednesday , while the Lakers travel to Houston to clash with the Rockets on Thursday ."
26,February,2018,Monday,2017,Philips Arena,Atlanta,Georgia,16300,18100,4008,"The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Atlanta Hawks , 123 - 104 , at Philips Arena on Monday evening . The Lakers ( 26 - 34 ) have unquestionably shown tangible signs of improvement this season , but as is often the case with most young teams , they still tend to struggle more often than not when away from their home court . Road games like Monday 's against struggling teams can represent an opportunity to build confidence , however , and Los Angeles clearly came into the contest with precisely that mindset . The visitors had forged a 28 - 22 lead by the end of the first quarter , an advantage they extended to 64 - 46 by intermission . The 18 - point cushion proved to be more than enough , as Atlanta could n't come anywhere close to catching up despite compiling 58 second - half points . As their final tally implies , the Lakers enjoyed a stellar offensive night , with all five members of the starting five and four reserves hitting double digits in the scoring column . They shot well from all over the court , posting a 52 percent success rate overall , including 46 percent from three - point range .

Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had an unusually active night on the glass , as he produced a final line consisting of 10 points , 14 rebounds , three assists and two steals . Kyle Kuzma ( 10 points , nine rebounds , three assists and one steal ) and Ivica Zubac ( 10 points , one rebound ) were productive off the bench as well . Taurean Prince 's 24 points , which he supplemented with three rebounds , three assists and three steals across 32 minutes , paced the Hawks . Dennis Schroder rebounded from an uncharacteristically poor showing last time out to generate 20 points , three boards , two assists , two steals and one block . Isaiah Taylor registered a bench - leading 16 points , three assists , one rebound and one steal . Kent Bazemore accounted for 12 points , four rebounds , four assists and one block .

The 28 - point final margin is unfair for the Knicks , as this game was close until the final 10 minutes . In fact , there were 10 ties and nine lead changes in total , as a 47 - 16 fourth quarter in advantage of the Warriors made this look like a blowout . Golden State ended up shooting 59 percent from the field and 49 percent from long range while holding New York to just 43 percent from the field and 33 percent from long range . The assist - to - turnover differential was a big part of that , with the Warriors recording nine more assists than the Knicks while committing five fewer turnovers .

He also added nine rebounds and five assists to his line on 17 - of - 24 shooting . Stephen Curry tallied 29 points , four rebounds and two assists .

The Blazers came out strong to start the third quarter , extending their lead to as much as 15 at points . The hot start to the second half allowed the team to manage minutes carefully , as C.J . McCollum was the only Portland player to log more than 30 minutes of action . McCollum also led the team in scoring , notching 20 points on 8 - of - 13 shooting . McCollum was the top performer for Portland 's offense , as star point guard Damian Lillard struggled a bit in his second game back from a hamstring injury .

Seven Portland players scored in double digits on the night . The league - worst Hawks ( 10 - 28 ) , meanwhile , have now lost eight straight road games in what has been a tough season so far .

The playoff - hungry Jazz ( 42 - 32 ) capitalized on an opportunity on Sunday , as Golden State ( 54 - 19 ) was without all four of its All-Star players . MVPs Steph Curry ( MCL ) and Kevin Durant ( rib ) will be hoping desperately to get healthy before the playoffs , while Klay Thompson ( thumb ) and Draymond Green ( pelvis ) are dealing with more short - term injuries . Still , all four were absent from Sunday 's tilt , clearing a path for Utah to earn a wire - to - wire win .
