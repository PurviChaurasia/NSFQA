The Lakers hung with the Bulls in the first half , playing competitively and physically behind Julius Randle , who strung together another strong performance to the tune of 22 points and 12 rebounds on 10 - of - 19 shooting . Randle is averaging a double - double on the season now , and entered the game with just over 10 rebounds a game , but it was his shooting percentage that needed work , and he showed promise for the second half of the season after a tough matchup with Pau Gasol and Taj Gibson throughout the game . The Lakers put together a 18 - 4 scoring run midway through the fourth quarter , which pulled the game within five points , but Derrick Rose drained multiple clutch shots down the stretch which kept the Lakers out of reach . D'Angelo Russell got the start in favor of Lou Williams , a decision that we do not know is permanent yet , but it was Randle 's first start since December 12 . The rookie point guard totaled 15 points and six assists in 34 minutes , while Williams pitched in 11 points off the bench . Bryant scored 22 points on 8 - of - 20 shooting in his farewell game to Chicago . The Bulls combination of Derrick Rose , E'Twaun Moore and Pau Gasol was nearly unstoppable , as each player exploded for a 20 - plus point performance . The third quarter exploited the Lakers defensive issues , where Chicago extended a small halftime lead to 15 points by the end of that quarter . Rose and Moore both finished with 24 points , and the backcourt shot a combined 18 - of - 29 from the field . Gasol added 21 points , seven rebounds and five assists to round out the box score , and pitched in a needed midrange bucket within two minutes of regulation . The Bulls bench was lead by Bobby Portis and Doug McDermott , who combined for 35 points , as both exceeded 20 minutes of playing time . The Lakers will visit the Milwaukee Bucks ( 23 - 33 ) for a second game of a back - to - back on Monday , while the Bulls host the Washington Wizards ( 25 - 29 ) on Wednesday ."
