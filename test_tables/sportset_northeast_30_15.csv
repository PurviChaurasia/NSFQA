With both teams having already been eliminated from the playoffs , this game was more about giving the young and inexperienced players a chance to make an impression on the coaching staff in hopes of coming back with their team next season in a bigger and better role .

The Sixers also received a ton of production off their bench from the likes of Hollis Thompson and Thomas Robinson . Thompson finished with 19 points ( 8 - 15 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt ) and four assists , while Robinson ended with 13 points ( 5 - 7 FG , 3 - 3 FT ) and 10 rebounds .

They were effective on the other end of the floor as well , eliciting 17 turnovers from the Nets while limiting them to 42 percent shooting , a figure partly comprised of an unsightly 25 percent success rate from three - point range .

After a strong first half where the Cavaliers out - scored the Sixers 50 - 37 , the Sixers made a strong push in the second half and fought their way back to take a 93 - 92 lead with just under 10 seconds left in regulation after Tony Wroten converted on a layup .
