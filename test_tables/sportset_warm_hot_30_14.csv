The Bucks still sport a disappointing record , but have slowly begun piling up victories against some superior teams . Last week saw Milwaukee rattle off wins against the likes of the Chicago Bulls and Atlanta Hawks , as well as the talented but underachieving Charlotte Hornets . A new week started with more of the same , as Milwaukee exploited a depleted Heat squad by scoring an impressive road triumph at the American Airlines Arena , where Miami had tallied a 15 - 8 record coming into tonight 's contest . The same formula that 's largely spearheaded the Bucks ' recent successes - - leaning on the talented triumverate of Khris Middleton , Giannis Antetokounmpo and Greg Monroe - - worked well again Tuesday , and proved pivotal in helping the visitors keep their momentum going . Middleton put together his seventh 20 - point - plus performance in the last eight games , tallying 22 points , seven rebounds , seven assists and a pair of steals . Greg Monroe extended a notable streak himself , posting a sixth straight double - double with 15 points , 10 rebounds , an assist and a block . Meanwhile , the Greek Freak contributed 14 points , six rebounds , four assists and a block . With his talented teammates putting together such productive performances , Antetokounmpo only needed to take 10 shot attempts on the night . Jerryd Bayless paced the Milwaukee bench with 11 points , three rebounds , three assists and a steal . The Bucks improved to 19 - 25 and currently reside in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They now head to Houston to take on the Rockets in a Friday showdown . Miami put together a valiant effort with somewhat of a rag - tag lineup , and Hassan Whiteside did his best to put the offense on his shoulders . The four - year pro registered his fourth straight double - double with 23 points , 18 rebounds , an assist and a pair of blocks . Chris Bosh , the next healthiest talented Heat player at the moment , matched Whiteside 's scoring output and added five boards , two assists and a steal . Luol Deng was the only other member of the Miami roster with double - digit scoring , totaling 11 points , four rebounds and two assists . The ailing Dwyane Wade , he of the two sore shoulders , could only tally a season - low two points over 21 minutes , while Tyler Johnson pitched in three points , four rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals . Amar'e Stoudemire and Gerald Green paced the Heat bench with a pair of modest six - point efforts . Miami fell to 23 - 19 , their fifth loss in the last six games . They currently reside in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division and now head to Washington to take on the Wizards in a Wednesday showdown ."

After scoring 36 points , including his team 's last 14 , on Monday , Donovan Mitchell followed up with a team - high 35 points in Wednesday 's win .

It was nice bounce back game for him after shooting only 33 percent against the Lakers on Sunday .

While his totals were well below his season averages of 25 points and 11 assists , it was still enough to get the Pelicans a victory . Omer Asik chipped in with 16 points and 14 rebounds , giving him his fifth game in a row with at least 10 rebounds . It was also his fifth double - double of the year . Jrue Holiday was the only other Pelican to reach double figures in points , as he finished with 13 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) , seven assists and six rebounds . As has been the case over the last few weeks , the Knicks received most of their production from Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire . Stoudemire led all scorers with 26 points ( 11 - 18 FG , 4 - 6 FT ) , while also grabbing five rebounds . It was a season high for Stoudemire , who 's only reached the 20 - point mark one other time this season . Anthony on the other hand shot 6 - for - 11 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 17 points and added eight rebounds . He did n't get nearly as many shots off as he has most of the season so far , so it resulted in scoring less than his season average of 23 points per game . With the other starters struggling to make an impact , the only other player to reach double figures was Jason Smith , who came off the bench to score 17 points ( 6 - 18 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) . He 's now combined for 37 points in the last two games , as he 's been a big factor off the bench for the Knicks .

The Magic and Knicks played a very strange game on Wednesday , as both teams shot terribly , but did n't make many mistakes . In fact , Both teams shot below 40 percent from the field and the two teams combined for just 18 turnovers . Defense was clearly the focus for both teams , as the Knicks failed to record a fast - break point all game long . There were very little differences in the stat sheet and it simply came down to the fact that the Magic 's bench signicantly outplayed the Knicks bench . Orlando got 43 bench points to the Knicks 12 and that proved to be the difference . The Knicks came into this game as one of the hottest teams in the league , but struggled offensively in this matchup . This Scott Skiles defense stifled the Knicks , despite the fact that Carmelo Anthony and Jose Calderon scored season - highs in points . Anthony had his best game of the season statistically speaking , as he tallied 28 points and 13 rebounds in the loss . Calderon also had his best game in years , as he totaled 25 points , four assists and three rebounds in the defeat . It was the `` others `` who killed this team though , as no other player scored more than 10 points in the loss . It 's clear that this team plays better when Anthony takes less shots and that was the fact yet again on Wednesday . The Knicks will play the Miami Heat on Friday in their next scheduled game . The Magic made a strange move by relegating Victor Oladipo to the bench , but that proved to work wonders here . It 's unclear if it lit a fire under him or that he just played better in the second unit , but Oladipo had one of his best games of the season in that role . Oladipo scored a team - high 24 points off the bench and did that damage in just 26 minutes of action . Tobias Harris , Nikola Vucevic and Elfrid Payton all recorded double - doubles as well , and this was one of the best all - around team efforts the Magic have had all season . Orlando will look to play like this again when they take on the struggling Milwaukee Bucks on Friday ."

Anthony Davis does it all for his team , and that trend continued Friday with him recording 29 points , 14 points , two assists and one steal in 42 minutes . He also added to his all - time franchise record with three blocked shots . Eric Gordon did his best to help out Davis but his 20 points were n't enough to defend their home court against the Celtics . New Orlean 's point guards Tyreke Evans and Norris Cole combined for 12 turnovers , which proved to be very costly in the end . The Pelicans are the first team on the outside looking in at the Western Conference playoff picture . New Orleans will host the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday and the Celtics will take on the Orlando Magic on Sunday ."

5,April,2015,Sunday,2014,Sleep Train Arena,Sacramento,California,16700,17300,490,"The Utah Jazz ( 35 - 42 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 26 - 50 ) 101 - 95 on Sunday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento . While both teams have already been eliminated from playoff contention , it was still another hard fought game Sunday . Both teams shot very similar percentages , with the Jazz going 46 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three - point line , while the Kings went 48 percent from the floor and 33 percent from deep . This marked the fifth straight loss for the Kings , as they look to improve their draft positioning for the 2015 NBA Draft . The Jazz got their biggest offensive contribution from Rodney Hood , who led this team to the close victory . The rookie finished with a team - high of 25 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) , to go along with four steals . He 's only averaging 8 points on the season , but he 's put together two impressive performances in a row , combining for 42 points and five steals . His four steals were also a career - high . While Gordon Hayward struggled to just five points ( 2 - 11 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt ) , it was Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors who gave Hood the most help . Gobert finished with 10 points ( 5 - 7 FG ) , nine rebounds and two blocked shots , while Favors added 11 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 1 - 1 FT ) and five rebounds of his own . Favors could have put up some higher numbers , but he was limited to just 16 minutes , as he was given a light work load due to the season wearing down and nothing much left to play for . Favors has averaged 16 points and 8 rebounds so far this season , both of which are the best numbers of his five - year career . With Rudy Gay sitting out another game due to suffering a concussion earlier last week , it was Ben McLemore who gave DeMarcus Cousins the most help on the offensive side of the ball . McLemore shot 8 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score 20 points , while also contributing five rebounds and four steals . McLemore has struggled with his consistency over the course of this season , so the Kings ' coaching staff would love to see McLemore show some added improvement as the second - year guard 's season comes near to its end . The four steals also matched a season - high for him . Cousins , on the other hand , posted a game - high of 26 points ( 11 - 22 FG , 4 - 9 FT ) , to go along with 12 rebounds and four assists . It marked his sixth double - double in a row , a stretch where he 's averaging an impressive 28 points and 17 rebounds . The only other King in double figures was Omri Casspi , who chipped in with 14 points ( 5 - 10 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and five rebounds .

Quite unexpectedly , the Pistons were able to keep their winning streak alive and extended it to six games in a row Tuesday . After the Pistons came out of the third quarter leading 82 - 77 , the Spurs went on a fourth quarter run , out - scoring the Pistons 27 - 23 . It was n't enough though , as the Spurs turned the ball over late when Tony Parker could n't handle an inbound pass from Tim Duncan and in turn Brandon Jennings took advantage , hitting a running bank shot with under a second left in the game to steal the victory . The Pistons had contributions from all over the court with six players reaching double figures in points . Andre Drummond led the charge , finishing with a monster line of 20 points ( 8 - 10 FG , 4 - 9 FT ) and 17 rebounds . It was his second double - double in a row , as he 's combined for 35 points and 31 rebounds over his last two outings . Greg Monroe notched a double - double of his own , going for 17 points ( 7 - 10 FG , 3 - 4 FT ) and 11 rebounds . The Pistons ' big men had their way in this game , as both were extremely efficient all night long . Along with the game - winning shot , Jennings had 13 points ( 5 - 18 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and seven assists . While it was n't his best night shooting , he came in clutch when it mattered , so you ca n't argue with his performance . Coming off the bench , D.J . Augustin had a strong game . He went off for 19 points ( 8 - 18 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) and five assists , coming one point short of matching a season - high . For the Spurs , Tim Duncan did everything he could to combat the big night of the Pistons big men . Duncan went 7 - for - 12 from the field to score 15 points , while also adding seven rebounds and two blocks . He struggled to only four points in Saturday 's game against the Wizards , so it was a nice bounce back outing for him . Having a big night off the bench was Jeff Ayres . Ayres went 5 - for - 8 from the field and 6 - for - 7 from the free throw line to score 16 points in only 16 minutes . It was far and away a season - high for him , after reaching double - digits in points only one other time this season . Tony Parker was able to get the start after missing the last five games with a hamstring injury . He ended up only playing 12 minutes though , and finished with three points and a pair of assists . Both Danny Green ( 5 - 10 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt ) and Marco Belinelli ( 4 - 8 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 2 - 2FT ) had strong shooting efforts in this one , finishing with 13 and 12 points respectively .

Atlanta has gotten back on track with four consecutive victories after being blown out by Toronto in its first game back from the break . Along with Schroder and Bazemore 's big outings , John Jenkins contributed 12 points and seven rebounds . Elton Brand stepped into the starting lineup and added seven points and eight rebounds . The Hawks will return to action Tuesday against the Rockets . Miami lost its second game in as many nights as it fell to Atlanta for the third time this season on Saturday . Hassan Whiteside 's incredible 14 - point , 24 - rebound outing was n't enough to negate Miami 's poor shooting effort . Miami finished the game shooting just 40 percent from the floor and 7 - for - 26 from beyond the arc . The Heat 's loss allows several teams to gain ground on them in the Eastern Conference playoff race . Miami is idle Sunday before hosting Phoenix on Monday ."

The Suns overcame a double digit deficit to pull the game within striking distance in the fourth quarter after a pair of free throws and a three - point bucket from Markieff Morris had Phoenix down nine points , but Rudy Gobert was rock solid from the free throw line , draining six straight to aid the Jazz in what could have been a tight game down the stretch . Devin Booker put the nail in the coffin after dunking home the last needed basket with just over :30 remaining . The Jazz were led by both Rodney Hood and Gordon Hayward , who combined for 47 points 16 - of - 35 shooting . Hayward added six rebounds , three assists and two blocks to round out the box score , while Hood pitched in four boards and three baskets from behind the arc . Rudy Gobert did the majority of his damage from the charity stripe down the stretch and finished with 13 points , 13 rebounds and four blocks on 9 - of - 12 free throw shooting in 34 minutes . Derrick Favors and Raul Neto each finished in double figures to round out an all around strong performance from the Utah starters . The bench was stretched a bit thin as Trey Burke ( illness ) did not play and Trey Lyles only saw five minutes of court time . The Jazz will visit the Dallas Mavericks ( 28 - 25 ) on Tuesday . The Suns were handed their seventh straight loss and continue to look sloppy on both ends of the floor . With Brandon Knight ( groin ) sidelined , Phoenix turned to Archie Goodwin and Devin Booker to lead the backcourt , but neither player has Knight 's impact and that was evident in Saturday 's matchup . Booker pitched in 18 points and Goodwin scored 14 , but they combined for a lowly four assists , as the frontcourt was unable to finish at the rim . Markieff Morris was given a volume shooting role , but was inefficient throughout the game , scoring 17 points on 22 shots , to go along with seven rebounds and eight assists . The Suns will look to bounce back when they host the Oklahoma City Thunder ( 38 - 14 ) on Monday ."

They got it down to a two - point lead late in the fourth quarter , but did n't get any help from OKC . Gordon Hayward led the team with 19 points , eight rebounds and three assists in the loss .

Julius Randle strung together another double - double with 10 points and 11 rebounds , while his frontcourt partner , Roy Hibbert , finished with zero points and two boards in a weak showing from the veteran . Kemba Walker 's torrid shooting did not have a large impact on the Hornets all around effort , as the frontcourt combination of Michael Kidd-Gilchrist , who made his season debut on Friday against the Blazers , and Marvin Williams contributed 38 points and 24 rebounds . Even more impressively , they combined to go 6 - of - 10 from behind the arc , which constantly kept the game far out of reach from the Lakers .
