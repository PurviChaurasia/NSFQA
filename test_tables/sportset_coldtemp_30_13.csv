Once Chicago returns from their midseason respite , the Detroit Pistons await on Friday , Feb. 20 in the Palace of Auburn Hills . Thursday 's defeat doubles as Cleveland 's second in four outings , but LeBron James did everything in his power to keep the deficit somewhat close , accruing 31 points , five rebounds , and four assists . However , with Kevin Love out of commission as a result of a corneal abrasion sustained during Wednesday 's win against the Miami Heat , the road was all the more winding when 16 turnovers were transformed into 24 points for the Bulls . The Cavaliers ' foibles on offense were compounded by miserable success from three - point range - - just 8 - for - 31 , or 26 percent - - and subsequently , just three of James ' teammates scored in double figures , including Kyrie Irving ( 17 ) , Timofey Mozgov ( 13 ) , and Tristan Thompson ( 10 ) . After the break , Cleveland will embark upon a three - game road trip , tipping off first against the Washington Wizards on Friday , Feb. 20 ."
