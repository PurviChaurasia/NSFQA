Through six games , Lillard is averaging just over 34 points on over 52 percent shooting . Friday 's 42 - point outing marked his highest scoring night of the season , though that was a high bar for Lillard to hop ; in six games , he has scored no lower than 27 and has eclipsed 35 points three times . For Dallas , meanwhile , offseason addition Harrison Barnes has seen his role shift with the Mavericks . After playing in a loaded Golden State offense , Barnes has been able to see the ball in his hands plenty in Dallas . With 17 points on Friday , Barnes remains Dallas 's top scorer , having reached double digits in all five games thus far .The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the host Dallas Mavericks on Friday , 105 - 95 , behind 42 points from point guard Damian Lillard . It was a tight game until the fourth quarter , as Portland ( 3 - 3 ) held just a three - point lead at the end of the third . It was Lillard time the whole way , however , as the point guard delivered his highest - scoring performance of the season thus far . Lillard 's 42 - point eruption on 12 - of - 18 shooting helped make up for cooler nights from backcourt partner C.J . McCollum , who scored just nine points , and the Portland bench , who combined for just 14 . The team played a perimeter - focused game , scoring 36 points on three - point shots , including 15 from Lillard . Dallas ( 0 - 5 ) , meanwhile , saw yet another loss come in Friday 's matchup . The team has yet to pick up a win in the 2016 - 17 season , and has seen major shooting struggles thus far . These struggles continued against Portland , as the team shot just 41 percent from the field . Veteran team leader Dirk Nowitzki , who was recently sidelined due to an illness , came back to play just 16 minutes on Friday . Nowitzki scored only five points on 2 - of - 6 shooting . Shooting guard Wesley Matthews , meanwhile , was seemingly invisible on the floor , shooting just 1 - of - 6 and recording no rebounds and one assist in 29 minutes of play . Portland will face off against Memphis on Sunday , while Dallas will hope to finally pick up a win as they host Milwaukee .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

He finished this game with 29 points , 17 rebounds and 11 assists en route to his 15th triple - double of the season . Many of the statistics were lopsided for the Thunder , as they dominated from start to finish . Rebounding was very decisive , as Oklahoma City won that battle , 46 - 32 . Fastbreak points and points in the paint were huge as well , with the Thunder outscoring the Heat , 58 - 32 in the paint and 16 - 4 in fastbreak points . Steven Adams was the only other Thunder starter in double figures , as he totaled 15 points and eight rebounds on 7 - of - 10 shooting . Enes Kanter came off the bench to provide 19 points and eight rebounds of his own . Josh Richardson was the lone bright spot for Miami , as he led the team with 22 points , five rebounds and three assists .The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the host Miami Heat , 106 - 94 , at America Airlines Arena on Tuesday . While Miami got out to an early lead , that was the only one they 'd have all game . In fact , the Thunder led for the final 40 - plus minutes , as they pulled out a near wire - to - wire win . Rebounding was the biggest factor to the Thunder 's success , as they won that battle , 46 - 32 . Fastbreak points and points in the paint were also decisive , as Oklahoma City outscored Miami , 58 - 32 in the paint and 16 - 4 in fastbreak points . The Thunder finished the game shooting 51 percent from the field , while holding the Heat to just 44 percent . Oklahoma City ( 20 - 12 ) have riden the back of Russell Westbrook all season and he carried the load once again here . Westbrook notched his 15th triple - double of the season , as he accumulated 29 points , 17 rebounds and 11 assists in the win . Steven Adams was the only other starter in double figures , as he totaled 15 points and eight rebounds . Enes Kanter was a nice spark off the bench , providing 19 points and eight rebounds . On deck for the Thunder is a road matchup against the Memphis Grizzlies on Thursday . Miami ( 10 - 22 ) had to play this game without Goran Dragic and it clearly hampered them in this loss . Josh Richardson had been struggling this season , but he was a nice bright spot in this loss , tallying a career - high 22 points , five rebounds and three assists . The Johnson 's once again led the bench in scoring , as Josh Johnson accrued 16 points and five rebounds , while Tyler Johnson dropped 15 points , two rebounds and two assists . Hassan Whiteside really struggled , as he went 4 - of - 11 from the field and committed four turnovers en route to a 12 - point and eight - rebound dud . The Heat will look to play better on Thursday in a road matchup against the Charlotte Hornets .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

Carmelo Anthony ( knee ) returned to the starting lineup after missing Friday 's game against the Memphis Grizzlies with knee soreness , but it was not enough to give the Knicks a needed spark , as they now own a five game losing streak . Anthony finished with 21 points , six rebounds and seven assists on 7 - of - 19 shooting in just under 35 minutes , but it was not the scoring output they needed to break New York out of a slump . Kristaps Porzingis struggled early , only completing two of his first nine attempts from the floor , and was a major part of Denver storming out to an eleven point lead at the end of the first quarter . Porzingis did finish strong on the shooting end to salvage what was close to his worst shooting performance of the season , as the lanky rookie scored 21 points on 10 - of - 23 shooting , to go along with 13 rebounds , two assists and two blocks . Langston Galloway went back to his bench role as Derek Fisher did not go with a three guard lineup with Anthony returning to the small forward slot , but Galloway still saw 20 minutes of game time and finished with six points , as both buckets came from behind the arc . The Knicks will look to end their skid when they host the Washington Wizards ( 22 - 27 ) on Tuesday . The Nuggets did not have a player score more than 20 points in the game , but their unselfish style of play lent way to an early first half lead and strong fourth quarter finish . Denver 's only bad quarter came in the third quarter , where some tough shots just did not fall . Danilo Gallinari and Will Barton led the Nuggets with 19 points each , but rookie point guard Emmanuel Mudiay has been playing very well since returning from injury and it is beginning to have a great impact on the team . Mudiay is coming off a 22 point performance against the Bulls on Friday , and added 19 points on Friday , to go along with four rebounds and nine assists . The young Nuggets squad started another rookie alongside Mudiay , center Nikola Jokic , who scored 13 points and grabbed six rebounds in 18 minutes . Denver was able to coast to a win in the waning minutes of the fourth quarter , doing most of their damage from the free throw line to consistently keep the Knicks out of reach . The Nuggets will play a back - to - back and hop from Manhattan to Brooklyn to take on the Brooklyn Nets ( 13 - 39 ) on Monday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

Denver was bolstered by strong play from forward Kenneth Faried , who exploded for an efficient 24 points while pulling down 10 rebounds . Faried had an unusually strong performance , hitting 10 of 16 shots from the field and leading the Nuggets in scoring . Rookie Nikola Jokic also played a huge part in the Denver win , scoring 20 points and grabbing nine boards while dishing out three assists . The rookie has played few minutes thus far this season , but has shown signs of high potential , as evidenced by his strong showing on Tuesday . 30 points from Carmelo Anthony was not enough for the Knicks to secure a win , as no other starter reached double digits in scoring . Melo hit all of his 11 free - throws while going 9 - for - 18 from the floor , putting the team on his shoulders in an otherwise sloppy performance by the struggling Knicks .

Ever since he regained a spot in the starting lineup at point guard in Elfrid Payton 's stead three games ago , Victor Oladipo has played with a renewed vigor and confidence.The talented guard has now posted 18 , 20 and 20 points , respectively , over those three contests , while shooting an outstanding 60 percent from the field during that span . Oladipo was stellar again Friday , sharing the team lead with 20 points and adding nine rebounds , a pair of assists , three steals and a block . Considering his recent performances , the Magic will certainly have a good problem on their hands upon Payton 's return to health from his ankle injury , as they 'll be faced with trying to get a talented backcourt trio that also includes Evan Fournier sufficient playing time . Nikola Vucevic was Oladipo 's co - leading scorer on the night with a 20 - point , 10 - rebound double - double that also included four assists , a pair of steals and a block . Unsurprisingly , the productive outing came against a Nets defense that has allowed the most points per game ( 22 ) to opposing centers this season . Fournier made it three starters with double - digit scoring by tallying 13 points , which he supplemented with three assists , a rebound and a pair of steals . Aaron Gordon had an efficient 14 - point , five - rebound effort off the bench over 23 minutes to lead the Orlando reserves . The Magic improved to 20 - 17 and are currently in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They head home to face the Wizards on Saturday . The Nets ' ninth straight home loss was due in large part to the suffocating defense of an Orlando unit ranked in the top 10 in points allowed per game ( 99 ) . They stymied Brooklyn across the board , with Brook Lopez serving as the top scorer with a modest 17 points . He added eight rebounds , a steal and a block . Joe Johnson continued his solid offensive play of late with a serviceable 13 points , three assists , three rebounds and a steal . Shane Larkin and Thaddeus Young were able to contribute 12 and 11 points , respectively , with the former also pitching in four rebounds , three assists and a steal , and the latter hauling in nine boards and matching Larkin 's production in the other categories . Bojan Bogdanovic was notably held to two points , while Wayne Ellington scored eight to pace the Brooklyn bench . The Nets fell to 10 - 26 and remain in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head to Detroit to take on the Pistons on Saturday night .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

The Cavs likely got more than they bargained for from a game Sixers squad that played them tough through all four quarters . Philadelphia 's collective defensive effort may have been the most surprising aspect of the game overall , as they managed to hold a hot Cleveland offense to a mediocre 39 percent shooting performance from the field , and 28 percent from beyond the arc . To provide some more tangible perspective on the noteworthiness of the Sixers ' effort , one has to realize the Cavs had tallied 53 and 48 percent figures , respectively , in those same categories against the Timberwolves in their most recent contest , and had also scored over 120 points in their two previous games . Cleveland was able to pull out the hard - fought victory on the back of LeBron James , who turned in a 37 - point , seven - rebound , nine - assist effort that also included a pair of steals . The other starters ' scoring contributions paled in comparison , as Kevin Love was the next closest with 15 points . However , Love was outstanding on the glass against a vulnerable Philadelphia frontcourt , hauling in 15 rebounds and adding seven assists and two steals . J.R. Smith added 14 points , three rebounds and a steal , and drained another four three - pointers in the process . Tristan Thompson had his own double - double in another start at center , collecting 10 points and grabbing 10 boards . Kyrie Irving had a second consecutive quiet game , notching eight points , five rebounds , two assists , two steals and a block over 31 minutes . Although his contributions in non - scoring categories were certainly solid , Irving notably struggled from the field , draining only three of 15 shot attempts . The Cavs improved to 26 - 9 and remain atop the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They now head to Dallas to take on the Mavericks on Tuesday . Philadelphia 's valiant effort was spearheaded by Jahlil Okafor 's 21 points , which he supplemented with seven rebounds . Ish Smith put together a second straight strong performance after a string of relatively quiet games , tallying a double - double with 18 points and 10 assists . He also added seven boards and a steal . Jerami Grant and Nik Stauskas could only put together a pair of six - point outings , while Hollis Thompson paced the Philadephia bench with eight points and three rebounds . The Sixers fell to 4 - 36 and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division .

Indiana committed 21 turnovers , 12 of which came from the starting five . However , four players from the first unit also managed double - digit scoring , as did two reserves , providing the visitors with a balanced attack . The Pacers also managed a 50 percent success rate from the field overall , and played solid defense on Victor Oladipo 's three - point attempt in the closing seconds to prevent the go - ahead basket . Rookie Myles Turner subsequently hauled in the key defensive rebound , and made two free throws to help seal the tough road triumph . Monta Ellis led the way for Indiana with 21 points , which he supplemented with four rebounds , three assists , two steals and a block .

With the season winding down and only a handful of games across the league left to play , the Kings came away with a road win without DeMarcus Cousins and Rajon Rondo . Cousins was shut down for the season and Rondo was written down for rest , although it is unlikely he plays the final game on the schedule . Sacramento had little trouble getting out to a lead before halftime , but poor foul shooting down the stretch and a lowly 18 point fourth quarter gave Phoenix some daylight to catch up . The Suns were also shorthanded , as Tyson Chandler ( concussion ) was sidelined alongside Brandon Knight and Archie Goodwin ( ankle ) . Seth Curry had a career night and flashed some of his older brothers range and passing ability which had the commentators regularly saying `` we have seen the before ! `` . Curry finished with 20 points , which led all Kings scorers , and added 15 assists and three rebounds . Ben Mclemore joined Curry in the backcourt and contributed 14 points and seven rebounds , while Rudy Gay pitched in some highlight reel dunks on his way to 15 points , six rebounds and two steals . Quincy Acy was able to knock down the two needed free throws to prevent a last second chance for the Suns in the waning seconds of the fourth quarter and finished with nine points off the bench . The Phoenix starters mostly finished in double figures and that included three players who eclipsed 10 rebounds , but it was Mirza Teletovic who shined in 34 minutes off the bench . Teletovic added 26 points on 10 - of - 20 shooting , to go along with three rebounds , one assist and two steals . The undrafted 30 - year old forward has strung together an impressive five game stretch , where he has averaged 22 points on 47 percent shooting and proved to be a bright spot on the Suns underwhelming roster . Alex Len , Jon Leuer and P.J . Tucker finished with double - doubles in the points and rebounds department , and as a unit , Phoenix dominated the rebounding battle 51 - 40 , but their 41 percent shooting kept them out of the game . Both teams play their final games of the season on Wednesday , as the Kings will visit the Houston Rockets ( 40 - 41 ) in a win or go home game for James Harden 's crew , while the Suns host the playoff bound Los Angeles Clippers ( 52 - 28 ) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

The Clippers have dominated both ends of the floor en route to a league - best record , and Monday was no exception . It was a big night for the Clippers ' starting five , as three players scored 20 or more points and each starter scored at least 10 . The dynamic All-Star duo of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin scored 26 points each . DeAndre Jordan , meanwhile , scored 17 and hit 9 - of - 14 from the free - throw line . In the third quarter , the Raptors began to employ the common strategy of `` hacking `` the big man in hopes of missed free - throws . Instead , Jordan hit 5 - of - 6 in a three - possession stretch , putting the Clippers up by as much as 17 . Despite a valiant comeback attempt , Los Angeles was able to maintain the sizeable lead . Toronto ( 8 - 6 ) has now lost four of its last five outings and is falling in the Eastern Conference standings . Boston is now tied with Toronto for the lead in the Atlantic Division . The Raptors experienced heartbreak following a controversial overturned buzzer - beater in Sunday 's outing against Sacramento .

The 76ers led for the vast majority of the game and stretched their lead to as much as 16 early in the third quarter . But the Kings managed to hang around enough to let their starters make a run late in the fourth quarter . Trailing by six with 3:44 to go , Rajon Rondo made a layup that sparked an 11 - 2 run to give the Kings a lead they would n't relinquish . DeMarcus Cousins led the Kings with 28 points ( 8 - 18 FG , 12 - 17 FT ) and 12 rebounds for his third double - double in the past five games . Darren Collison had a huge game off the bench , as he poured in 25 points ( 9 - 12 FG , 2 - 2 3PT , 5 - 6 FT ) and turned the ball over just once in 32 minutes . Rudy Gay scored 22 and Rajon Rondo added 14 points with a game - high 15 assists as the Kings managed to win despite shooting just 4 - 16 ( 25 percent ) from three . Robert Covington drained seven of his 11 three - point attempts en route to a game - high 29 points , just part of a three - point barrage from the 76ers , who shot 15 - 34 ( 44 percent ) from deep . Jahlil Okafor scored 26 points working inside ( 11 - 18 FG , 4 - 5 FT ) and added 10 rebounds , five assists and two blocks , and Nik Stauskas scored 16 behind a 4 - 5 effort from three .

Utah held just a 43 - 42 lead after a tight first half , but the Jazz ended the quarter on a 26 - 8 run to carry a 14 - point lead into the fourth quarter . The Bucks went without a field goal for a 6:58 stretch in the period as their offense just could n't get revved up . Utah never trailed in the game 's final period as they coasted to the victory . Gordon Hayward scored 18 points and hit three three - pointers to lead the Jazz . The Jazz also got double - doubles from Rudy Gobert with points 12 ( 4 - 7 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) and 14 rebounds ( six offensive ) and Shelvin Mack with 13 points ( 5 - 11 FG ) and 12 assists . Trey Lyles added 14 points in just 22 minutes off the bench as he also grabbed four rebounds and dished four assists . The Jazz were launching three - pointers all game , and managed to hit 13 of 37 attempts ( 35 percent ) . Jabari Parker of the Bucks finished with a game - high 19 points ( 8 - 14 FG ) and added eight rebounds and a pair of assists . Khris Middleton ( 13 points ) and Giannis Antetokounmpo ( 12 points , seven assists , four rebounds , two steals , two blocks ) were the only other Bucks to even reach double - figures . The Bucks actually shot a solid 34 - 65 ( 52 percent ) from the floor , but they managed just two offensive rebounds and hit only three three - point shots , and even their relatively efficient performance inside was n't enough to keep up with the Jazz 's three - point barrage . The Jazz continue their road trip Wednesday in Houston . The Bucks head to Detroit for a Monday matchup against the Pistons .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

The Grizzlies ( 18 - 9 ) were back to full strength Wednesday after the return of Marc Gasol ( rest ) , but the Cavaliers ( 18 - 6 ) were not , as head coach Tyronn Lue elected to rest his big three of Kevin Love , LeBron James and Kyrie Irving . Without them , Cleveland , as expected , had a tough time getting anything going on offense and Memphis took advantage . The Grizzlies seized control of the game from the very start and never let up , led by their big man in the middle Gasol , who posted a double - double of 17 points and 11 rebounds . However , the biggest performance of the night came unexpectedly off the bench from Troy Daniels , who scored an efficient 20 points in just 22 minutes . As a team , Memphis shot just 43 percent from the field but were on fire from long range , hitting 12 of their 23 shots from behind the arc . On the other hand , there was n't much to take away from this game for the Cavaliers since they played without their three best players . Their two top scorers both came off the bench Wednesday , with veteran sharpshooter James Jones scoring a team - high 15 points and rookie Kay Felder adding a career - high 14 points . Overall , though , it was a miserable shooting night for Cleveland , as they shot just 37 percent from the field overall and 64 percent from the free throw line . On top of that , they managed just 10 assists to their 12 turnovers . Up next , the Grizzlies will stay home Friday to take on the Kings , while the Cavaliers will have off until Saturday when they play the Lakers .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

His performance Wednesday night was the worst of them all , with Bledsoe shooting just 3 - of - 15 while still managing to come up with 16 points thanks to some good free throw shooting . But this is starting to become a trend , as Bledsoe has shot 13 - of - 47 ( 28 percent ) from the field over his last four contests .

As a team , Memphis managed to do heavy damage from long range , shooting a hot 14 - of - 24 ( 58 percent ) from behind the arc . The victory did come , however , with a bit of recklessness , as the Grizzlies recorded 22 total turnovers on just 24 assists . For the Suns ( 16 - 37 ) , their struggles continued , as Wednesday 's loss was their third in a row and eighth in the last nine games . And this one was one of the more forgetful outings , as the team shot just 33 percent from the field and 22 percent from behind the arc . They also managed to play rather recklessly , recording just 13 assists to their 15 total turnovers . Devin Booker ended up leading the way with a team - high 20 points , while Eric Bledsoe had a disastrous night shooting from the field , going just 3 - of - 15 en route to scoring 16 points .

After a tight first half , the Hawks were able to claim a 14 - point lead with under six minutes remaining in the fourth quarter , but a run of nine unanswered points by the Hornets resulted in an outcome that was too close for comfort . Still , Atlanta was able to make enough stops down the stretch to deny the late rally , as Kemba Walker missed the game - tying attempt from 25 feet to give Atlanta the victory . Though he only scored a combined five points in the team 's first two games , Kent Bazemore was the Hawks ' surprising scoring leader Friday , pouring in 19 points on 7 - for - 13 shooting , including a 4 - for - 5 mark from three - point range . He also tacked on nine rebounds for good measure , a total that was only second to Paul Millsap 's 10 boards for the team lead . Millsap also accrued 18 points , while Al Horford ( 18 ) , Jeff Teague ( 14 ) , and Dennis Schroder ( 14 ) rounded out the double - digit scorers . Schroder made his first start of the season while Kyle Korver was rested for maintenance purposes in the second game of a back - to - back set . The winless Hornets were foiled by their top two offensive threats suffering from poor shooting nights . Al Jefferson and Kemba Walker both shot 5 - for - 15 from the field to combine for just 23 points between them , while no other scorer on the team exceeded 14 points . Charlotte was at least able to win the battle of the boards , 54 - 45 , thanks to double - digit rebound efforts from Marvin Williams ( 12 ) , Nicolas Batum ( 11 ) , and Jefferson ( 11 ) . The two teams will get together for a rematch Sunday , with that game to take place in Atlanta .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

The records of these teams would indicate a lopsided result , but this game was tight until the final whistle . While there were only eight ties and 13 lead changes , neither team was able to grab a double - digit lead for the entirety of the game . The key for the Warriors was the assist - to - turnover ratio , with the Warriors recording 30 assists to 12 turnovers , while the Pelicans committed 17 turnovers to 26 assists . That 's evident by the fact that Golden State took 13 more shots than New Orleans . Golden State ( 22 - 4 ) did n't have their best game here , but they escaped with a big road victory . Draymond Green was the second - lowest scoring starter , but accrued 12 points , 12 rebounds , 10 assists and four steals en route to another triple - double . Stephen Curry led the team in scoring . dropping 30 points , four rebounds and seven assists . Kevin Durant was n't far behind , as he scored 27 points on 10 - of - 19 shooting . The Warriors will look to keep rolling on Thursday , when they host the New York Knicks .

Jrue Holiday went just 3 - of - 12 from the field , but accumulated 10 points , eight rebounds , six assists and four steals in the defeat .

The Warriors won the turnover battle and that 's evident through the shot attempts , as Golden State took 95 shots to New Orleans ' 82 .

For the Thunder ( 12 - 8 ) , they continue to roll as they have now won four in a row after dropping three straight . Wednesday night , Russell Westbrook served as the hero , as not only did he drop yet another triple - double with 35 points , 14 rebounds and 11 assists , but he also hit a step - back 3 - pointer in the closing moments to send the game into overtime - - the only three he hit in the game . From there , he would not be denied a victory , as he went on to score 14 of the team 's 21 points in the overtime period , outscoring the Wizards , 14 - 10 , on his own . Westbrook 's night was n't the most efficient , however , as he shot just 12 - of - 35 from the field and 1 - of - 6 from behind the arc . Victor Oladipo , on the other hand , had a very efficient evening , shooting 10 - of - 16 from the field en route to 25 points on top of six rebounds and six assists . The Wizards ( 6 - 11 ) are now losers of two of their last three games as they continue to battle inconsistent play early in this season . Bradley Beal , however , has remained consistently deadly since returning from a hamstring injury that sidelined him for three games . His 31 points on Wednesday night was his second straight 30 - point effort in a row and he is now averaging 29 points over his last three games . His partner in the backcourt John Wall struggled shooting from the field , going just 6 - of - 20 overall and 2 - of - 7 from behind the arc , but he did record 15 points and 15 assists - - his second double - double in a row and fourth in the last five games . Washington will look back on this game , however , and see many missed opportunities at the free throw line , where they made just 16 of their 25 attempts . Up next , the Thunder will look to extend their winning streak on Sunday against the Pelicans , while the Wizards will head to San Antonio on Friday to take on the Spurs .Bradley Beal has been playing like an offensive juggernaut since returning from a hamstring injury that held him out for three games , and his 31 - point performance on Wednesday continued that trend . Since returning , Beal has been averaging 28 points while shooting 50 percent from the field overall . And while those numbers jump off the page , what may jump even higher off the page is the number of minutes he has been playing . Beal , who already has a rich injury history in this young season , has played at least 38 minutes in his last six games with the 42 he played against Oklahoma City being the highest he 's played all season . Head coach Scott Brooks has said that he needs Beal on the floor to give the Wizards a chance of winning the game , but with Beal failing to put together anything close complete NBA season in his career , the wear and tear on an already fragile body could be dangerous for a struggling Washington team .                                                                                                                                         |\n",

Small forward Chandler Parsons proved to be a key difference - maker in Saturday 's matchup , as he led the game with 26 points . Parsons was lights - out from the field , shooting 10 - for - 15 including 5 - for - 8 from beyond the arc . After beginning the season hampered by injuries , Parsons has begun to settle in since mid - January , and is now averaging 20 points in his last 10 outings . Also integral to the Dallas win was point guard Deron Williams , who served as an offensive general with 22 points and 11 assists dished out . As a whole , Dallas thrived behind the arc , hitting 15 three - pointers against a Grizzlies team notorious for poor shooting from deep . Memphis has held steady in the fifth slot in the Western Conference throughout the season . The `` grit and grind `` team shot an impressive 50 percent from the field , but could not seem to stop Dallas 's deadly three - point shooters . Big men Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph led the offensive effort , posting 22 points and 20 points respectively . Randolph also notched a double - double , pulling down 14 rebounds . The Grizzlies will host the Trail Blazers on Monday .

The Mavericks ( 26 - 29 ) and the Trail Blazers ( 33 - 22 ) played a thrilling game that seemed to be headed towards one direction , but Dallas flipped the script incredibly during the final 12 minutes of action to secure a huge win . In fact , Dallas won the first quarter by a one - point margin ( 25 - 24 ) , but Portland responded winning both the second ( 33 - 22 ) and third ( 35 - 31 ) quarters , so they were up by 14 points entering the final frame . It seemed as if the Trail Blazers were ready to secure the win , but Dallas came out of nowhere to flip the script and win the game thanks to an impressive fourth quarter , where they allowed just nine points while scoring 24 . Luka Doncic was the best player for the Mavericks since he finished with 28 points , nine rebounds and six assists , while Tim Hardaway Jr. chipped in with 24 points , four rebounds and three assists . Dorian Finney-Smith had 11 points with six boards , while Dwight Powell contributed with 13 points coming off the bench . Dirk Nowitzki came off the bench and played 13 minutes , but only had three points and three rebounds . Only three Portland players topped the 10 - point mark and as expected , most of the heavy lifting in this game was done by their Big Three . Damian Lillard led the way with 30 points , but he also added five assists , three rebounds and steals but also committed five turnovers . Jusuf Nurkic posted a strong double - double of 18 points and 10 boards , while C.J .

Memphis is left jockeying with Portland for the fifth seed in the West , holding just a single - game lead after Tuesday 's win . Injuries to star center Marc Gasol and point guard Mario Chalmers have left the team , once slated as a Western Conference contender , decimated and struggling to close out the season . Veteran Zach Randolph took matters into his own hands on Tuesday , however , going for 27 points and 10 rebounds en route to the big win . All-Defense team guard Tony Allen , meanwhile , showed off his lockdown skills on the perimter by stealing the ball four times . The team forced 20 turnovers as a whole in what was a solid defensive outing . The Bulls , meanwhile , look as though they may miss the playoffs for the first time since 2007 - 8 . With four games remaining , including matchups against the Heat and Cavaliers , and a 3 game deficit to overcome , the Bulls may find themselves on the outside of the postseason looking in . Tuesday 's double - digit beatdown did not instill confidence for the squad , as turnovers and free - throw shooting both looked weak in Memphis . Hitting just 68 percent of shots from the line , the Bulls struggled mightily at the charity stripe . All-Star Jimmy Butler was reduced to a non - factor by veteran defensive specialist Tony Allen . Butler scored just five points on the night . The Bulls face a make - or - break matchup on Thursday in Miami .

The Trail Blazers ( 22 - 18 ) had a great performance in this one , but they were forced to come from behind after they were down by two following the first quarter . But Portland did not back down , and won the subsequent two quarters to build a 14 - point lead against a Thunder ( 22 - 19 ) squad that looked clueless on defense . OKC tried to react in the final 12 minutes , but it was too late , and Portland escaped with a huge win on the road against a direct opponent for a playoff spot . The Blazers did n't have Damian Lillard , but C.J . McCollum replaced him and delivered a strong 27 - point , seven - assist performance to lead Portland . Shabazz Napier had a strong game as well , and the starting point guard contributed with 21 points , five rebounds , three blocks , and two assists . Jusuf Nurkic added 20 points and seven rebounds , while Pat Connaughton contributed with 10 points . Al-Farouq Aminu had 10 points as well , but added seven rebounds and two steals . Russell Westbrook put on a show for the Thunder after finishing with 22 points , 12 assists , nine rebounds , three steals and two blocks , but it was n't enough . Paul George also scored 22 points , while Carmelo Anthony contributed with 19 points , six rebounds , and two blocks . Steven Adams had 16 points with six rebounds , while Raymond Felton added 13 points off the bench .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

The Celtics ( 17 - 3 ) were apparently in a feisty mood after seeing their 16 - game winning streak snapped by the Miami Heat on Wednesday , or perhaps they played like a team no longer encumbered by the pressure of trying to maintain that torrid stretch . Either way , Boston came out of the gates on a mission Friday , blowing out the Magic ( 8 - 11 ) by a 73 - 47 margin in the first half . The sizable lead allowed them to essentially cruise in the third and fourth quarters , and only a 34 - point tally in the final period by Orlando made the final score somewhat respectable . The Celtics ' defense was in typically superior form , with no Orlando starter posting more than 12 points , and two of them scoring in single digits . Meanwhile , with a comfortable second - half lead , Boston 's reserves saw extended playing time , with four players logging at least 22 minutes and the second unit compiling a collective 47 points overall . The Magic was paced by Jonathon Simmons , who managed 14 points , three rebounds and one assist in 24 minutes off the bench . Nikola Vucevic was tops among the starters with a 12 - point , 11 - rebound double - double that also included two assists , three steals and one block . Elfrid Payton matched Vucevic 's point total and added six boards and three assists . Marreese Speights was the third player to accomplish the tally , and he supplemented it with five rebounds and one assist in 22 minutes off the bench . Aaron Gordon provided 11 points , seven boards , one assist and one steal . Evan Fournier had one of his poorer nights of the season , going just 3 - for - 13 from the field on his way to a seven - point performance . He also brought down five rebounds , dished out two assists and recorded one steal . Kyrie Irving managed to get in a game 's worth of scoring despite playing just 25 minutes , as he supplied 30 points to go along with four rebounds , three assists and one steal . Terry Rozier followed with a bench - leading 23 points , which he complemented with six rebounds , two assists and one steal . Jaylen Brown registered 13 points , four assists , two rebounds , two steals and one block . Aron Baynes matched Brown 's point total and added 11 rebounds and two assists in 22 minutes off the bench . Jayson Tatum collected 11 points , two rebounds , two blocks and one steal in a modest 22 minutes . Marcus Morris totaled nine points , six boards and three assists while drawing the start . Al Horford mustered just five points but also tallied 10 assists , four rebounds and two blocks .

Jeff Teague 's 17 points led starters and he added eight assists , five rebounds and three steals . It was a team effort , as the Hawks recorded a brilliant 25 - to - 12 assist - to - turnover ratio as a team and nailed 13 of their 33 three - point shots ( 39 percent ) . Bulls center Pau Gasol led all scorers with 20 points ( 9 - 16 FG ) and added 10 rebounds and five assists . Derrick rose scored 14 but struggled from the field ( 6 - 18 FG ) .

Rodney Stuckey and C.J . Miles each scored 24 points to lead Indiana past the Pistons . The game was tied going into the fourth quarter and came down to the wire , but point guard George Hill hit six straight free throws in the final 81 seconds to seal the victory for his playoff - hopeful Pacers . Indiana is one game behind the Brooklyn Nets and Boston Celtics , who hold the final two playoff spots in the Eastern Conference . Both the Nets and Celtics won their games on Friday to keep their advantage over the Pacers . Indiana has won four straight , but face three teams with winning records in their final three games . Greg Monroe put up another solid performance in just his second game back after an 11 - game absence because of a knee injury . He had 17 points , 12 rebounds and three assists . His point guard Reggie Jackson had a nice game , and like Monroe , is a free agent to be this offseason . Jackson had 21 points and nine assists . He 's averaging 20 points and 11 assists in April . However the Pistons are 1 - 4 this month and have been eliminated from playoff competition . The Pistons will take on the Charlotte Hornets , as Indiana will host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

The Cavaliers ( 13 - 7 ) entered this game riding an eight - game winning streak , and it was clear they are clicking on all cylinders right from the tip off . The Sixers ( 11 - 8 ) battled hard and at one point decreased Cleveland 's advantage to three points , but the Cavs did n't slow down in the fourth quarter and pulled away en route to a comfortable win . As a result , Cleveland clinched their ninth straight win and remain one of the top teams in the East , while the Sixers saw a three - game winning streak come to an end . LeBron James shined for the Cavaliers with a strong performance of 30 points , 13 rebounds , and six assists . Kevin Love added 13 points and J.R. Smith contributed with 11 , but there is no question the real difference maker here for the Cavs was the play of the bench . Cleveland 's second unit outscored the starters 57 - 56 , and three players scored in double digits . Dwyane Wade had 15 points , Jeff Green had 14 , and Channing Frye added 12 . Joel Embiid did a very good job in the paint and led Philadelphia 's offense with a double - double of 30 points and 12 boards . Ben Simmons finished with 10 points and eight rebounds , but only made five of 11 field - goal attempts . T.J. McConnell did a good job off the bench with 11 points and six rebounds , although the Sixers struggled with their shooting . They went 3 - for - 28 from three - point range and shot 38 percent overall .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

It marked a tough loss for the Hornets , as the Boston Celtics jumped a half game ahead of them for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings . With just 13 games left in the regular season , the Hornets are going to need to pick up some winning momentum moving forward , as teams like the Heat , Celtics , Pacers and Nets all sit within three games of each other and will fight for the final two playoff spots in the East . The Bulls , on the other hand , have clinched their spot in the playoffs and still sit as the fourth seed in the standings , with the Toronto Raptors sitting just above them with the tie breaker . With a strong finish to the season , they 'll have the opportunity to pass up the Raptors , but they could be passed up themselves , as the Washington Wizards are trailing the Bulls by just two games . Nikola Mirotic continued to have a huge presence for the Bulls , recording over 20 points for the fourth time over his last five games . In 32 minutes off the bench , he finished with a team - high of 28 points ( 10 - 19 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 7 - 10 FT ) , while also adding eight rebounds and a blocked shot . Over his last five games , he 's now boasting averages of 21 points , 8 rebounds and 2 blocks , while shooting 43 percent from the field . Pau Gasol was also a force in this game , posting 27 points ( 11 - 19 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) of his own , to go along with 12 rebounds and four blocked shots . He 's posted two double - doubles in a row , combining for an impressive 54 points and 22 rebounds over those two matchups . On the season , Gasol is now averaging 19 points and 12 rebounds as the clear leader of this team . The biggest news for the Bulls though , was seeing Jimmy Butler return to the starting lineup after missing 12 games with an elbow injury . He did n't seem to have any trouble with his elbow and posted 19 points ( 6 - 20 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 7 - 10 FT ) and nine rebounds , while playing a full 39 minutes . Aaron Brooks added a double - double as well , finishing with 13 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) and 10 assists . The Hornets struggled to get things going offensively Monday . Kemba Walker was one of the few exceptions , going off for a game - high of 29 points ( 11 - 24 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) with two assists in 34 minutes . He had shot under 40 percent from the field in nine straight games coming into Monday , so it was good to finally see him have a better night with his shot and come out shooting 46 percent from the floor . Mo Williams came off the bench again in this one and scored 15 points ( 4 - 16 FG , 3 - 9 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) , while also posting six rebounds and five assists . He 's had two solid showings in a row , combining for 39 points , 10 rebounds and nine assists over that span . The only other Hornet in double figures was Gerald Henderson , who chipped in with 11 points ( 3 - 12 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 5 - 6 FT ) and nine rebounds , despite having a tough night shooting the ball . Al Jefferson had to leave the game after just 24 minutes with soreness in his right knee , so the Hornets can only hope it does n't continue to keep him out moving forward . The Bulls ' next game will be on the road against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday , while the Hornets will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday . |\n",

Gerald Green 's first season in a Heat uniform has been anything but dull . The veteran has managed to overcome recent personal problems to serve as an integral part of the Miami bench , as well as a terrific spot starter . Green filled in at small forward for Luol Deng for a second consecutive contest and propelled the Heat to a road victory with a team - high , game - high , and season - high 25 points . The particularly remarkable aspect of his performance was the fact that Green had only tallied only 5 points by intermission . However , a second - half offensive barrage that included three of his four three - pointers on the night helped Miami significantly extend what had been a razor - thin 50 - 49 halftime lead , and cruise to an eventual 21 - point win . Green 's effort was complemented nicely by Chris Bosh , who managed 20 points , five rebounds , three assists and a block . Dwyane Wade pitched in with 17 points , five rebounds and a trio of assists . Hassan Whiteside had his worst shooting night of the season , going only 1 - for - 6 from the field , making it his first single - digit scoring night in over two weeks and only the fourth game in which he has scored under 10 points . However , the standout center did haul in 14 boards , the third consecutive game in which he 's hit double - digit rebounds . Rookie Justice Winslow received a robust 35 minutes off the bench , and although he was n't terribly efficient with them , he did round out the stat sheet nicely . The Heat 's 2015 first - round pick finished with nine points , seven rebounds , an assist and a steal . The Heat improved to 10 - 5 and are in possession of first place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They remain home for a date with the Celtics on Monday . The Knicks were thoroughly stymied by Miami 's suffocating defense , shooting only 38 percent from the field for the game and barely seeing two of five starters crack double - digit scoring . Carmelo Anthony was one of those players , but the superstar small forward could only muster 11 points , three rebounds , an assist and a steal over 34 minutes . It tied the veteran 's season - low scoring total , which he 'd posted in the opener versus Milwaukee . Kristaps Porzingis matched Anthony 's 11 points and added eight rebounds , two steals and three blocks . Robin Lopez , Arron Afflalo and Jose Calderon-the rest of the starting five - - only totaled eight points between them . Reserve forward Kevin Seraphin was the only other New York player to reach double figures , tallying 10 points , three rebounds and an assist over a very efficient 17 minutes . The Knicks fell to 8 - 9 and currently reside in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They remain home for a date with the Rockets on Sunday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

The Knicks ( 4 - 6 ) came in losers of two straight and looking for an immediate improvement of a porous defense that had allowed an average of 110 points coming in . They were able to right both matters for the moment Monday , stifling the Dallas Mavericks ( 2 - 7 ) to the tune of a season - low point total . Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis led the way as usual , contributing a pair of 24 - point efforts . One particularly notable item from the home team 's stat sheet was Justin Holiday 's play as compared to that of Joakim Noah , who he replaced to start the second half . While the latter went scoreless over 15 minutes , the former posted 16 points over 25 minutes on the floor , leading the bench . The Mavericks , playing once again without Dirk Nowitzki ( Achilles ) , were led by Harrison Barnes , who supplied 20 points , four rebounds , an assist , a steal and a block . J.J. Barea drew another start in place of Deron Williams ( calf ) , registering 17 points , four assists and a rebound . Unfortunately for Dallas , that was it for double - digit scoring performances , as they shot just 39 percent from the field and posted an unsightly 5 - of - 28 tally ( 18 percent ) from beyond the arc . Seth Curry paced the bench with nine points , five rebounds , three assists and a steal , but was 1 - of - 7 himself from three - point range . Anthony added seven rebounds , three assists , a steal and a block to his scoring haul , while Porzingis complemented his point total with 11 boards , an assist and a block . However , the trio of Noah , Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee combined for just 10 points on 4 - of - 15 shooting . Holiday , who helped spearhead a second - half - opening 19 - 6 run , added four rebounds , two assists , two steals and a block to his aforementioned 16 points . The Mavericks continue their tour through the Northeast with a Wednesday showdown in Boston against the Celtics , while the Knicks remain home for their Wednesday date with the Pistons .The Mavericks , which posted a season - low point total , were led by Harrison Barnes , who supplied 20 points , four rebounds , an assist , a steal and a block .

As part of a plan to keep starters fresh for the playoffs , LeBron James was given the night off by coach Tyronn Lue , placing a greater degree of responsibility on fellow superstar Kyrie Irving . The All-Star guard , as he often did prior to James ' return at the start of last season , largely placed the offense on his shoulders , but it was a key defensive play on his part that helped seal the victory . Irving totaled a game - high 33 points , and added five rebounds , an assist , a block and a steal with 3 seconds left on a pass intended for Dirk Nowitzki . He was fouled right after swiping the ball , and sunk two decisive free throws to provide just enough cushion to withstand Deron Williams ' three - pointer at the buzzer and still allow Cleveland to walk away victorious . Kevin Love pitched in with a strong effort of his own to support Iriving , tallying 23 points , 18 rebounds , an assist and a pair of blocks . J.R. Smith was next with 13 points , four rebounds , four assists and three steals .

The Celtics will visit the Lakers on Friday , while Cleveland will see Atlanta .The Celtics broke out of a mini - slump with numerous strong performances on Wednesday .

The big story for the Clippers has been the absence of forward Blake Griffin , who is out at least two weeks with a quad injury . The thing is , Los Angeles does n't seem to be missing Griffin that much after a third straight win - - second with Griffin sidelined . The Clippers jumped out to a commanding lead in the first quarter behind Chris Paul , who finished with a team - high 23 points and seven assists . Center DeAndre Jordan also stepped up big with Griffin out , pouring in 15 points with 13 rebounds , though Los Angeles lost the battle on the boards 45 to 37 . In the end , Paul was able to get the best of John Wall , who managed to score 23 points , but disappeared late in the game in going scoreless in the fourth quarter . Despite the late - game struggles , Wall still dished out 11 assists and has posted six consecutive double - doubles . Otto Porter Jr. finally looked healthy , scoring 21 points on 8 - of - 12 shooting with three 3 - pointers and eight rebounds over 33 minutes . Porter Jr. had only played 19 minutes in the Wizards ' previous game and had missed three prior to that while dealing with a thigh injury . The unsung hero of the night for the Clippers was Jamal Crawford , who is known to rise to the occasion throughout his career . He came off the bench to score 21 points on 9 - of - 12 shooting and three treys to provide some extra scoring punch behind Paul and Jordan . Other role players also stepped up ; Cole Aldrich had his best game of the season with 13 points , six rebounds , four steals and three assists in 20 minutes , while Wesley Johnson added 14 points .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

After taking a 32 - 18 lead after the first quarter , the Knicks were unable to deal with the Cavaliers ' defense and caved in during the second half . LeBron James did an excellent job containing Carmelo Anthony , who finished with just 17 points on 6 - of - 18 shooting from the field . James registered 23 points ( 9 - 23 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 4 - 7 FT ) , while adding five rebounds , four steals , and three assists in 35 minutes . The two superstars are now tied in their careers against each other with 12 wins apiece . The Knicks rolled with a 12 - man rotation Wednesday , and it did n't help them find much offense in a dismal second half . Rookie Kristaps Porzingis was New York 's second - leading scorer with 13 points , which just was n't enough secondary scoring to keep up with the Cavaliers . Langston Galloway had 12 points in 29 minutes off the bench , but the Knicks ' backcourt contingent left a lot to be desired . The Cavs were a tough frontcourt matchup for Robin Lopez and company , so expect them to bounce back Friday against the Bucks . With J.R. Smith ( knee ) sidelined for the second consecutive game , the Cavaliers did n't miss a beat , getting another big performance from Mo Williams . The veteran guard poured in 22 points ( 8 - 19 FG , 2 - 8 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , six rebounds , and four assists in 36 minutes . Williams has really stepped up for the Cavs with Kyrie Irving out . Cleveland really showed why they are a championship contender by suffocating the Knicks on defense , but they had a very off night shooting the ball , finishing 33 - for - 83 from the field ( 40 percent ) . The Cavaliers host the Sixers on Friday after defeating them 107 - 100 earlier in the week .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

In a game that was never separated by more than 12 points , the Raptors were able to prevail by getting to the basket at will . Both teams shot very efficiently , as they both shot over 55 percent from the field . The big difference was the interior play , as the Raptors scored 68 paint points , while holding the Wizards to just 28 . Turnovers were an issue for Washington as well , as they committed 21 and allowed the Raptors to score 31 points off those turnovers . Toronto ( 3 - 1 ) continues to score at will and they are riding the hot shooting hand of DeMar DeRozan . The shooting guard has scored at least 32 points in all four games this season and finished this outing with a 40 spot . He added five rebounds and five assists with his 40 points and shot 14 - of - 23 from the field and 11 - of - 16 from the free - throw line . Kyle Lowry was the only other starter with more than 10 , as he scored 18 points and recorded four steals in the win . Patrick Patterson and Terrence Ross were a nice spark off the bench , accumulating 25 points , five rebounds and four assists . Washington ( 0 - 3 ) has gotten off to a rough start this season , as the defense continues to struggle . In fact , they have now allowed at least 112 points in every game so far this season . John Wall did everything he could to pull out a win though , as he tallied a season - high 33 points , 11 assists and five rebounds in the loss . It was n't all sunshine and roses though , as Wall also committed nine turnovers and missed two late crucial free - throws . Otto Porter had his best game of the season , totaling 23 points and 13 rebounds on 11 - of - 13 shooting . Bradley Beal and Marcin Gortat finished with 15 points a piece as well . Both teams return to action on Friday , as the Raptors host the Miami Heat and the Wizards host the Atlanta Hawks .The Wizards continue to be let down by their defense , as they had no rim protection in this loss . Not only did they allow the Raptors to shoot 56 percent from the field , they also allowed them to accrue 68 points in the paint . The bench production was a huge factor as well , with Toronto 's five bench players combining for 34 points , 14 rebounds , 11 assists and seven steals . In contrast , Washington 's five bench players finished with just 11 points , four rebounds and four assists combined . The 40 - point outing marks DeRozan 's fourth - straight game with at least 32 points and he 's the only player in the league to score 30 - plus in every game so far . The 33 points and 11 assists from John Wall make for his best game of the year , but the nine turnovers are a season - worst as well . Wall now has double - digit assists in all three games this season .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

The Wizards have considerably struggled throughout the season defending opposing shooting guards . This surprisingly held true when Bradley Beal , who has a good reputation on the defensive side of the ball , was healthy , and has persisted while he 's been sidelined over the last two - plus weeks with a lower leg problem . The deficiency reared its ugly head again Wednesday against one of the top two - guards in the NBA . DeMar DeRozan led all scorers with 34 points , and added six rebounds , five assists , two steals and two blocks . He drained 17 of those in the first half , a total that partially consisted of a perfect 8 - for - 8 performance at the free - throw line . He preserved the pristine effort from the charity stripe in the second half , finishing 15 - for - 15 for the game . The visitors were led by Otto Porter , Jr. , who tallied 20 points , nine rebounds and a pair of assists , his second straight 20 - point - plus outing . John Wall followed with yet another double - double , managing 19 points and adding 11 assists . He also produced seven rebounds , five steals and a block in a terrific all - around effort . It was Wall 's seventh straight double - double , as he continued his stellar play during Beal 's extended absence . Jared Dudley ( 17 points ) and Marcin Gortat ( 12 points , nine rebounds ) also made solid contributions , while Ramon Sessions was highly efficient in pacing the Wizards bench with 11 points , seven rebounds and four assists . The Wizards dropped to 14 - 16 and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They will head home to face the Orlando Magic on New Year 's Day . With respect to the Raptors starters , it was essentially DeRozan and not a whole lot else . Kyle Lowry ( 11 point , six assists , three rebounds , two steals ) was the only other front - line player that amassed double - digit scoring , while Terrence Ross and Bismack Biyombo were both outstanding off the bench . Ross collected 14 points and six rebounds while Biyombo produced a double - double in his first game back in a reserve role , tallying 12 points and hauling in 12 boards . The man that he 'd been replacing while he healed from a broken hand , Jonas Valanciunas , posted eight points and nine rebounds . The Raptors improved to 20 - 13 and continue atop the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They remain home for a New Year 's Day showdown against the Charlotte Hornets .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

The Clippers ( 37 - 25 ) had checked in to Saturday night uncharacteristically struggling , particularly on defense . They 'd lost four of their five games coming out of the All-Star break and had surrendered over 120 points in three of those contests . However , they got back to fundamental Clippers basketball against the Bulls ( 31 - 31 ) , limiting them to 42 percent shooting from the field and 35 percent from three - point range , while also eliciting 19 turnovers . Jamal Crawford stepped up off the bench by scoring a game - high 25 points and adding two rebounds , two assists and two steal , and four other players also hit double digits in the scoring column . Chris Paul was next behind Crawford with 17 points , four assists , two rebounds , two steals and one block . Blake Griffin followed with 16 points , seven assists and six rebounds . J.J. Redick was effective in his usual complementary role , registering 13 points and one rebound . Luc Mbah a Moute had a rare offensive outburst by his standards , totaling 12 points and adding three rebounds , one assist and one steal . DeAndre Jordan generated a modest six points but did haul in 14 rebounds , dish out three assists and record a steal . The Bulls were led by Jimmy Butler , who tallied 16 points , six assists , four rebounds and three steals . Robin Lopez generated 12 points , six rebounds and two assists .

The Knicks ( 4 - 6 ) came in losers of two straight and looking for an immediate improvement of a porous defense that had allowed an average of 110 points coming in . They were able to right both matters for the moment Monday , stifling the Dallas Mavericks ( 2 - 7 ) to the tune of a season - low point total . Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis led the way as usual , contributing a pair of 24 - point efforts . One particularly notable item from the home team 's stat sheet was Justin Holiday 's play as compared to that of Joakim Noah , who he replaced to start the second half . While the latter went scoreless over 15 minutes , the former posted 16 points over 25 minutes on the floor , leading the bench . The Mavericks , playing once again without Dirk Nowitzki ( Achilles ) , were led by Harrison Barnes , who supplied 20 points , four rebounds , an assist , a steal and a block . J.J. Barea drew another start in place of Deron Williams ( calf ) , registering 17 points , four assists and a rebound . Unfortunately for Dallas , that was it for double - digit scoring performances , as they shot just 39 percent from the field and posted an unsightly 5 - of - 28 tally ( 18 percent ) from beyond the arc . Seth Curry paced the bench with nine points , five rebounds , three assists and a steal , but was 1 - of - 7 himself from three - point range . Anthony added seven rebounds , three assists , a steal and a block to his scoring haul , while Porzingis complemented his point total with 11 boards , an assist and a block . However , the trio of Noah , Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee combined for just 10 points on 4 - of - 15 shooting . Holiday , who helped spearhead a second - half - opening 19 - 6 run , added four rebounds , two assists , two steals and a block to his aforementioned 16 points .
