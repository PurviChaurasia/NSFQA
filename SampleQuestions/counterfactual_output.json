                "summary": "The Chicago Bulls defeated the Memphis Grizzlies , 122 - 110 , at United Center on Wednesday evening . The hometown Bulls ( 14 - 44 ) got off to a surprisingly fast start against the typically defensive - minded Grizzlies ( 23 - 36 ) , racking up 67 first - half points . However , given Chicago 's defensive vulnerability , Memphis essentially kept pace , and the hosts ' lead was only five at intermission . The Bulls kept coming in the third by adding another four points to their advantage , and a 13 - 7 run over the first 3:4 of the final period gave them the cushion they 'd need for the double - digit home win . Chicago shot especially well and dominated on the boards , draining 56 percent of its attempts while outrebounding the visitors by a 47 - 31 margin . Avery Bradley put together a second straight productive outing by pacing the Grizzlies with 15 points . He added five assists , one rebound and one steal . Jaren Jackson , Jr. , Mike Conley , Jonas Valanciunas and Delon Wright generated a quartet of 12 - point tallies . Bruno Caboclo and Joakim Noah had eight points apiece , with the former also supplying five rebounds and two assists , and the latter totaling three boards , three dimes and two blocks . Otto Porter , Jr. paced the Bulls with a career - high 37 points and supplemented them with 10 rebounds , two assists and one block . Robin Lopez furnished 25 points , five rebounds , one assist and two blocks . Lauri Markkanen generated a 21 - point , 10 - rebound double - double that also included six assists and one steal . Zach LaVine delivered 15 points , seven assists and six rebounds . Cristiano Felicio led the bench with eight points . Ryan Arcidiacono drew the start for Kris Dunn ( back ) and mustered just two points but also dished out 11 assists , hauled in six rebounds and recorded a steal . The Grizzlies are now off until Feb. 22 , when they 'll host the Los Angeles Clippers . The Bulls return to action that same night with a road matchup against the Orlando Magic ."

Ever since he regained a spot in the starting lineup at point guard in Elfrid Payton 's stead three games ago , Victor Oladipo has played with a renewed vigor and confidence.The talented guard has now posted 18 , 20 and 20 points , respectively , over those three contests , while shooting an outstanding 60 percent from the field during that span . Oladipo was stellar again Friday , sharing the team lead with 20 points and adding nine rebounds , a pair of assists , three steals and a block . Considering his recent performances , the Magic will certainly have a good problem on their hands upon Payton 's return to health from his ankle injury , as they 'll be faced with trying to get a talented backcourt trio that also includes Evan Fournier sufficient playing time . Nikola Vucevic was Oladipo 's co - leading scorer on the night with a 20 - point , 10 - rebound double - double that also included four assists , a pair of steals and a block . Unsurprisingly , the productive outing came against a Nets defense that has allowed the most points per game ( 22 ) to opposing centers this season . Fournier made it three starters with double - digit scoring by tallying 13 points , which he supplemented with three assists , a rebound and a pair of steals . Aaron Gordon had an efficient 14 - point , five - rebound effort off the bench over 23 minutes to lead the Orlando reserves . The Magic improved to 20 - 17 and are currently in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They head home to face the Wizards on Saturday . The Nets ' ninth straight home loss was due in large part to the suffocating defense of an Orlando unit ranked in the top 10 in points allowed per game ( 99 ) . They stymied Brooklyn across the board , with Brook Lopez serving as the top scorer with a modest 17 points . He added eight rebounds , a steal and a block . Joe Johnson continued his solid offensive play of late with a serviceable 13 points , three assists , three rebounds and a steal . Shane Larkin and Thaddeus Young were able to contribute 12 and 11 points , respectively , with the former also pitching in four rebounds , three assists and a steal , and the latter hauling in nine boards and matching Larkin 's production in the other categories . Bojan Bogdanovic was notably held to two points , while Wayne Ellington scored eight to pace the Brooklyn bench . The Nets fell to 10 - 26 and remain in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head to Detroit to take on the Pistons on Saturday night ."

Kobe Bryant had a decent night shooting the ball as he continues his farewell tour , scoring 21 points on 8 - of - 16 shooting with eight boards and four assists . Larry Nance Jr. replaced Julius Randle in the starting lineup , but failed to outperform him . Randle scored 15 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 3 - 3 FT ) with 11 rebounds for his fifth double - double in six games .

Russell played 21 minutes off the bench , scoring nine points on 4 - of - 12 shooting from the field . Nick Young was held out of the lineup again by coach Byron Scott . After suffering two close losses to the Nuggets and Warriors - - each at home - - the Raptors got back on track , albeit barely , against the Lakers . With center Jonas Valanciunas sidelined with a fractured hand , Bismack Biyombo has seen a bump in playing time , and finally made it count Monday . Biyombo finished with a season - high 15 points ( 4 - 8 FG , 7 - 11 FT ) with 13 rebounds and two blocks over 29 minutes .

Harkless was complemented by another unlikely hero , point guard Shabazz Napier , who exploded for 21 points in the game . The duo helped push a Lillard-less Blazers over the top despite a nerve - wracking final few minutes . Los Angeles ( 11 - 20 ) lost a heartbreaker on Saturday , with poor late - game shooting making the difference . Shooting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed multiple three - pointers in the game 's final seconds , giving Portland the chance to pull away with the win . Despite the team 's shooting woes down the stretch , the Lakers saw stellar clutch play from a few of its young stars . Lonzo Ball in particular had a terrific end to the game , coming up with two blocked shots and a three - pointer in the final stretch of the game . Ball finished the night with a double - double , notching 10 points and 11 assists . Still , a win was not in the cards for the Lakers . Poor free - throw shooting was among the factors that cost the team on Saturday , as they went just 12 - of - 20 from the line . The tough performance at the stripe was far from uncharacteristic for LA , as the team ranks last in the league in free - throw percentage at just over 69 percent .
