Leonard was only asked to play 25 minutes , but scored 15 points and pulled down five rebounds against the Wolves . San Antonio has been a contender all season while not relying heavily on three - point shooting , as was illustrated by the Spurs ' bold 116 points on 56 percent shooting while hitting just four threes . The young Timberwolves saw strong performances from both of their first overall picks despite the blowout loss . Rookie sensation Karl-Anthony Towns showed off with 19 points and nine rebounds while shooting 9 - for - 17 from the field .
