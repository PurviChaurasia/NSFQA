George scored seven of his team - leading 21 points in the last 1:10 of the game , accounting for all but two of Indiana 's final nine points . The home team was also a force on the glass and around the basket throughout all four quarters against one of the more vulnerable frontcourts in the league that was also playing without starting center Roy Hibbert . They hauled in 53 rebounds , while also doubling up Los Angeles in the paint , 44 - 22 . Conversely , neither team was able to muster anything of note from the perimeter , with the Lakers and Pacers posting respective 23 and 15 percent tallies from behind the arc . The Lakers were spearheaded by Kobe Bryant 's 19 points , which he supplemented with five rebounds . As has been the case for a good portion of the season , Bryant 's poor accuracy necessitated a voluminous amount of shot attempts , 25 in this particular contest , to allow him to hit his scoring total . Julius Randle was right behind him with a momentous 15 - point , 19 - rebound double - double which he supplemented with three assists . Lou Williams tallied 13 points , three rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals . Jordan Clarkson contributed 10 points , three rebounds , two assists and a pair of steals as the fourth starter with double - digit scoring . 2015 first - rounder D'Angelo Russell outperformed Clarkson off the bench , pacing the reserves with a stat - sheet - stuffing performance consisting of 16 points , five rebounds , five assists , four steals and a block . The Lakers remain in last place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They now head to Cleveland to face off against the Cavaliers on Wednesday . George added nine rebounds , two assists , a steal and two blocks to his team - leading point total . George Hill was next in line with 15 points , six assists , a rebound and three steals . Myles Turner waged an entertaining one - on - one battle down low with Randle , recording his own double - double with 14 points , 13 rebounds and an assist . Ian Mahinmi pitched in with 11 points , five rebounds , an assist and a block , while Jordan Hill had a near double - double against his former squad , supplying nine points , nine rebounds , an assist and a block .

The game was certainly not as close as the final score suggests , as the Nets were in control for nearly all of Wednesday 's contest before the 76ers ' second unit , led by rookie Landry Shamet scoring 10 points in the final minute of the game , made a late push but ultimately just ran out of time . The main reason Brooklyn found itself in full control of the outing was the stellar play of Spencer Dinwiddie , who scored a career - high 39 points in just 30 minutes off the bench . The point guard shot 4 - of - 6 from three and a11 - of - 18 from the field overall , but he did most of his damage from the free throw line , where he was 13 - of - 14 . It was the fifth time this season the breakout 25 - year - old scored at least 25 points in a game . As for the rest of the Nets , Allen Crabbe was the high scorer out of the starters , posting 20 points while shooting 50 percent from the field . Joe Harris was 2 - of - 3 from behind the arc en route to scoring 14 points , while rookie Rodions Kurucs scored 13 points off the bench . As a team , the Nets were on fire from behind the arc , going 14 - of - 28 from deep . The 76ers had to play Wednesday 's game without star guard Jimmy Butler ( groin ) , and their star players certainly picked up some of the slack . Joel Embiid was a force down low , postig another massive double - double of 33 points and 17 rebounds in 38 minutes , while Ben Simmons had a terrific all - around performance with 22 points , eight rebounds , seven assists , four steals and two blocks . Lastly , Furkan Korkmaz , who started in Butler 's absence , scored 18 points for the second straight night . Offensive production , however , was n't the problem , as the 127 points the team gave up was the most Philadelphia allowed in nearly a month ."

It was a true collective effort for New York , particularly after losing superstar Carmelo Anthony in the second half due to an ankle sprain . Several of his teammates , both starters and reserves , stepped in to help make up the scoring shortfall caused by the All-Star 's absence , and the Knicks finished the night with outstanding 53 percent shooting from the field .

                "summary": "Playing without the services of Rudy Gay and Omri Casspi , DeMarcus Cousins was relied on even more than usual , and he responded with a game - high 33 points . However , the remaining members of Sacramento 's starting five posted single - digit scoring tallies , with Kosta Koufos ( six points , nine boards ) , Garret Temple ( five points ) , Ben McLemore ( five points ) and Darren Collision ( two points on 1 - of - 8 shooting ) all considerably underperforming . Ty Lawson was the only other player with double - digits in the scoring column , supplying 10 points off the bench . Dorian Finney-Smith led the way for Dallas with 17 points , while Harrison Barnes , Deron Williams and Wesley Matthews all had matching 15 - point efforts . Devin Harris ( 14 points , seven rebounds , an assist and a steal ) and Seth Curry ( 13 points , five rebounds , four assists , two steals ) were highly productive in reserve roles .The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Sacramento Kings , 99 - 79 , at American Airlines Center on Sunday . The Kings ( 10 - 17 ) checked in to the contest short - handed , as both Rudy Gay ( hip ) and Omri Casspi ( illness ) were sidelined . That put the onus on DeMarcus Cousins even more than usual , and he did respond with a game - high 33 points , along with six rebounds and a block . However , it was far from enough to offset single - digit scoring tallies from the remainder of Sacramento 's starting five . Meanwhile , the Mavs ( 7 - 20 ) saw six players hit double digits in the scoring column , while shooting a solid 45 percent from the field as a team . Kosta Koufos was the next most productive starter for the Kings , albeit a distant second to Cousins ' standout effort . Koufos posted six points , nine rebounds and a pair of steals . Garrett Temple and Ben McLemore posted a pair of five - point efforts , and Darren Collison turned in a disappointing two points , three assists and a rebound on just 1 - of - 8 shooting over 25 minutes . Ty Lawson paced the bench with 10 points , three assists , two rebounds and a steal . Dorian Finney-Smith led the way for Dallas with 17 points , three assists , two rebounds and a steal . Harrison Barnes was just short of a double - double with 15 points , nine boards , two assists , three steals and a block . Deron Williams and Wesley Matthews also had matching 15 - point efforts , while shooting a combined 11 - of - 23 . Devin Harris ( 14 points , seven rebounds , an assist and a steal ) and Seth Curry ( 13 points , five rebounds , four assists , two steals ) were highly productive in reserve roles . Sacramento heads back home for a Tuesday evening date with the Trail Blazers , while the Mavericks travel to Denver to take on the Nuggets on Monday night ."
