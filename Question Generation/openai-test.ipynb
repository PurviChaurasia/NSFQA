The Celtics have shown us moments of brilliance in the 2014 season , but they 're simply looking to pick up some momentum at this point . This was a solid win , as six players scored at least nine points . Brandon Bass lead the way off the bench scoring 23 points ( 9 - 13 FG , 5 - 7 FT ) , to go along with six rebounds , one assist , one steal and one block . Jeff Green posted a double - double , with 11 points ( 5 - 13 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) and 10 rebounds , while Rajon Rondo and Jared Sullinger both fell just short of double - doubles of their own . Sullinger had 22 points ( 10 - 15 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 1 - 3 FT ) with nine rebounds , while Rajon Rondo had nine points ( 3 - 5 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) and 13 assists . Boston heads to Memphis to take on the Grizzlies on Friday night next . The 76ers just ca n't get in the win column right now . They had five players score in double figures , but were led by Tony Wroten off the bench , who scored 21 points ( 7 - 19 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 6 - 9 FT ) , while contributing seven assists , three rebounds and one steal . Nerlens Noel and Michael Carter-Williams both started this game , with Noel scoring 10 points ( 5 - 10 FG ) and grabbing eight rebounds , while Carter-Williams scored 11 points ( 4 - 13 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , and grabbed six boards . Philadelphia will try to get their first win of the 2014 season at home against the Phoenix Suns on Friday night .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

Phoenix is in the midst of a six - game road trip . After dropping the first game of the trip 120 - 107 to the Los Angeles Clippers , they 've rattled off three consecutive wins over some of the never - weres of the Eastern Conference . Isaiah Thomas paced the Suns on Friday . He put up 23 points and eight rebounds in 24 minutes off the bench . They 'll continue their trip Saturday in Indiana against the Pacers . Philadelphia has lost 12 straight games to start the season . While that 's a deplorable situation to be in regardless of the situation , it 's in no way a surprise that the Sixers have n't been able to pull off a win . Tony Wroten started at shooting guard next to Michael Carter-Williams on Friday , an experiment the Sixers seemed to be opposed to coming into this season , and it 's a starting lineup that is unlikely to stick . K.J . McDaniels scored a career - high 17 points in 28 minutes , and the fact that he played so many minutes after commenting to the media that he is frustrated with his playing time indicates that the team did n't take much offense to his comments . The Sixers will have a legitmitate chance at their first win of the season Saturday when they go to New York to face the Knicks .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

Despite taking a 52 - 50 lead into halftime , the Sixers came out of the half cold and were out - scored by the Blazers 39 - 28 in the third quarter , allowing them to coast to the 10 - point victory . The Sixers big men also struggled with the Blazers ' bigs , as they were out - rebounded by a hefty 52 - 29 margin . This is the eigth straight victory for the Blazers , who now have the second best record in the Western Conference . LaMarcus Aldridge was an unstoppable force on Monday , as the Sixers ' young frontcourt had no answer for him . He went off for 33 points ( 13 - 20 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) and 11 rebounds , giving him his second straight double - double and fifth on the year . Fellow superstar Damian Lillard shot 6 - for - 11 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 16 points , while also grabbing five rebounds and handing out four assists . He 's now averaging 20 points and 7 assists on the year . Wes Matthews was the other major contributor on the offensive side of the ball , as he shot 6 - for - 16 from the field and 2 - for - 8 from beyond the arc to score 17 points in 32 minutes . The only other Blazer to reach double figures in scoring was Robin Lopez , who had 12 points and eight rebounds . The Sixers were led by Michael Carter-Williams , who scored a season - high 24 points , while also grabbing seven rebounds . It was his seventh game of the season after sitting out with injury , and he seems to be getting back in a rhythm . Fellow backcourt mate Tony Wroten also had a solid all - around game on Monday . He came one assist shy of his second double - double of the season and finished with 20 points and nine assists . The third Sixer who reached the 20 - point mark was starting center Henry Sims . Sims finished with 22 points , which was a nice surprise for the Sixers as he 's only averaging 9 points on the season . Coming off the bench , Nerlens Noel had 12 points and five rebounds . The Blazers ' next game will be on the road in Charlotte against the Hornets on Wednesday , while the Sixers will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday . |\n",

Seven-time All-Star Joe Johnson helped lead the Nets to victory by putting up 21 points ( 8 - 12 FG , 3 - 4 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and four assists . Brook Lopez was able to take advantage of Philadelphia 's lackluster interior defense by having a near double - double with 19 points ( 9 - 12 FG , 1 - 4 FT ) and seven rebounds . Besides that duo , there really was n't a standout performer , but their defense helped keep the 76ers to shooting only 40 percent from the floor . For the winless Philadelphia 76ers , Tony Wroten helped lead the team with 18 points ( 6 - 18 FG , 6 - 8 FT ) and 10 assists but committed eight turnovers .

Kirk Hinrich hit a pair of free throws to extend it to three with two seconds remaining , and a K.J . McDaniels heave at the buzzer fell well short of the rim . The Sixers , whose last two losses have come by a combined five points , were paced by another strong performance by Tony Wroten . Filling in as the starting point guard for Michael Carter-Williams ( shoulder ) , Wroten finished with 31 points but shot just 11 - of - 27 from the field . Thompson chipped in 21 points , while Henry Sims added 16 and eight rebounds . Nerlens Noel did not play after injuring his ankle against Orlando on Wednesday . Up next , the Sixers head to Toronto to take on the Raptors on Sunday evening . Chicago , meanwhile , travels back home to host the Celtics on Saturday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

The Celtics have shown us moments of brilliance in the 2014 season , but they 're simply looking to pick up some momentum at this point . This was a solid win , as six players scored at least nine points . Brandon Bass lead the way off the bench scoring 23 points ( 9 - 13 FG , 5 - 7 FT ) , to go along with six rebounds , one assist , one steal and one block . Jeff Green posted a double - double , with 11 points ( 5 - 13 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) and 10 rebounds , while Rajon Rondo and Jared Sullinger both fell just short of double - doubles of their own .

Boston heads to Memphis to take on the Grizzlies on Friday night next . The 76ers just ca n't get in the win column right now .

Phoenix is in the midst of a six - game road trip . After dropping the first game of the trip 120 - 107 to the Los Angeles Clippers , they 've rattled off three consecutive wins over some of the never - weres of the Eastern Conference . Isaiah Thomas paced the Suns on Friday . He put up 23 points and eight rebounds in 24 minutes off the bench . They 'll continue their trip Saturday in Indiana against the Pacers . Philadelphia has lost 12 straight games to start the season . While that 's a deplorable situation to be in regardless of the situation , it 's in no way a surprise that the Sixers have n't been able to pull off a win . Tony Wroten started at shooting guard next to Michael Carter-Williams on Friday , an experiment the Sixers seemed to be opposed to coming into this season , and it 's a starting lineup that is unlikely to stick . K.J . McDaniels scored a career - high 17 points in 28 minutes , and the fact that he played so many minutes after commenting to the media that he is frustrated with his playing time indicates that the team did n't take much offense to his comments . The Sixers will have a legitmitate chance at their first win of the season Saturday when they go to New York to face the Knicks .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

Despite taking a 52 - 50 lead into halftime , the Sixers came out of the half cold and were out - scored by the Blazers 39 - 28 in the third quarter , allowing them to coast to the 10 - point victory . The Sixers big men also struggled with the Blazers ' bigs , as they were out - rebounded by a hefty 52 - 29 margin . This is the eigth straight victory for the Blazers , who now have the second best record in the Western Conference . LaMarcus Aldridge was an unstoppable force on Monday , as the Sixers ' young frontcourt had no answer for him . He went off for 33 points ( 13 - 20 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) and 11 rebounds , giving him his second straight double - double and fifth on the year .

The only other Blazer to reach double figures in scoring was Robin Lopez , who had 12 points and eight rebounds . The Sixers were led by Michael Carter-Williams , who scored a season - high 24 points , while also grabbing seven rebounds . It was his seventh game of the season after sitting out with injury , and he seems to be getting back in a rhythm . Fellow backcourt mate Tony Wroten also had a solid all - around game on Monday . He came one assist shy of his second double - double of the season and finished with 20 points and nine assists . The third Sixer who reached the 20 - point mark was starting center Henry Sims .

Boston snapped their three - game losing streak with the win . Starting center Tyler Zeller picked up two early fouls , limiting his action , but backup Kelly Olynyk filled in exceedingly well off the bench , putting up a game - high 30 points to go with nine rebounds and two blocks . Rajon Rondo played just 24 minutes , as coach Brad Stevens has turned away from Rondo at times in recent games , an interesting development when taken in the context of the Celtics ' roster on a given night , as it appears Stevens simply does n't see Rondo as capable of leading the team to a win against certain matchups . Philadelphia has dropped four straight games . They could n't get much to work offensively Monday . As a team , the Sixers shot 36 percent from the field and 14 percent from beyond the arc . Furkan Aldemir signed a four - year deal with the team Sunday and made his debut Monday , putting up two points and two rebounds in 10 minutes off the bench . Tony Wroten led the Sixers in minutes played with 30 off the bench but did not score and recorded just four rebounds and one assist . Boston will host the Orlando Magic on Wednesday . The Sixers have three days off before they 'll host the Charlotte Hornets on Friday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

Charlotte ended their four - game losing streak with the win . Kemba Walker led the way with a game - high 30 points in 38 minutes . Al Jefferson put up a double - double of 20 points and 12 rebounds . The Hornets were playing without starting shooting guard Lance Stephenson . He is dealing with a pelvic injury that will keep him out of Saturday 's game against the Utah Jazz as well . Philadelphia has lost five straight games . On the bright side of things , the Sixers shot 45 percent from the field , 46 percent from beyond the arc and 88 percent from the free - throw line . However , as has been the case all season for the Sixers , they coughed up too many turnovers , giving up 34 easy points off of 24 turnovers . Coach Brett Brown opted to use a 10 - man rotation that gave every player on Philadelphia at least 11 minutes of action . Alexey Shved was traded to the Houston Rockets on Friday as part of a three - team trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves .

After a strong first half where the Cavaliers out - scored the Sixers 50 - 37 , the Sixers made a strong push in the second half and fought their way back to take a 93 - 92 lead with just under 10 seconds left in regulation after Tony Wroten converted on a layup . The Cavaliers then had a chance to take the lead with three seconds left on the clock , but Matthew Delavedova was unable to convert on a layup of his own and the Sixers then clinched with a pair of free throws to seal the deal . Philadelphia shot a superior 48 percent from the field , while Cleveland went just 39 percent from the floor . Along with making the go - ahead layup , Wroten also scored a team - high of 20 points ( 8 - 18 FG , 0 - 6 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , while adding eight assists . He 's now averaging 25 points per game over his last three outings , as he 's continued to be a consistent scoring threat off the bench for the Sixers . Michael Carter-Williams had a solid contribution of his own . He recorded his seventh double - double of the season , finishing with 18 points ( 8 - 19 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) and 13 assists . He was very successful against a young Cavaliers backcourt without the likes of Kyrie Irving . Robert Covington got the start at small forward in this one . He took advantage of the start and posted 16 points ( 4 - 9 FG , 4 - 7 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) and six rebounds in 39 minutes . He 's had a solid couple of games in a row , combining for 39 points over his last two outings . Both K.J . McDaniels and Henry Sims had 12 points apiece . The Cavaliers were without superstars LeBron James and Kyrie Irving , but were still expected to come into Philadelphia and secure the victory . Despite the loss though , Kevin Love was one of the few bright spots . He had a monster double - double , recording 28 points ( 8 - 18 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt ) and 19 rebounds . He also got to the free throw line 13 times , converting on 11 of those attempts . He 's now averaging 28 points and 11 rebounds over his last three outings , as he 's had to take it on himself to increase production with a few key members of the starting lineup sidelined . Tristan Thompson nearly had a double - double of his own and finished with 18 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 2 - 5 FT ) and nine rebounds . The only other Cavalier to reach double - digits in scoring was Joe Harris . Harris was in the starting lineup , going 6 - for - 12 from the field and 4 - for - 8 from the three - point line to score 16 points in 31 minutes . The Cavaliers ' next game will be at home against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday , while the Sixers will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday . |\n",

The Bucks out - shot the Sixers by a large margin in this one , going 54 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three - point line , while the Sixers went just 30 percent from the floor and a meager eight percent from beyond the arc . It was a sloppy game all - around though , as both teams turned the ball over more than 23 times . Despite shooting 18 less free throws , the Bucks still secured the 20 - point victory . The Bucks ' backcourt of Brandon Knight and Khris Middleton did the bulk of the damage in this one . Knight went 6 - for - 12 from the field and 4 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score 18 points , while also adding five assists . He 's had the hot hand lately and is averaging 21 points per game over his last five outings . Middleton on the other hand had a very efficient 18 points ( 7 - 9 FG , 2 - 2 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) of his own , but did it on the defensive side of the ball as well with five steals . The five steals were a season - high for Middleton . The Bucks did have a strong showing from their bench as well . O.J . Mayo recorded 15 points ( 6 - 11 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and six assists , while Jarryd Bayless went a perfect 6 - for - 6 from the floor to score 12 points of his own . Bayless did a little bit of everything in this game , as he also chipped in five rebounds , four assists and two steals . The Sixers had a brutal showing offensively , marked by a combined 2 - for - 25 from the three - point line as a team . They were led in scoring by rookie guard K.J . McDaniels , who went 5 - for - 8 from the field and 4 - for - 4 from the free throw line to score 14 points , while also adding six rebounds . He 's now put together a couple of solid games in a row , with 26 points over those two games . The only other starter to reach double figures in points was Nerlens Noel . Noel had 13 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 1 - 2 FT ) , five rebounds and two blocks in 28 minutes . He 's now had two blocks in three out of his last four games , continuing to make an impact on the defensive side of the ball . Michael Carter-Williams , who normally is the leader of this team , really struggled with his shot , going 1 - for - 13 from the field and 0 - for - 4 from the three - point line to finish with five points . The Bucks ' next game will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday , while the Sixers will travel to Brooklyn to play the Nets on Friday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

Facing a six - point deficit at halftime , the Sixers set themselves up for victory by outscoring the Pacers , 29 - 21 , in the third quarter , and Michael Carter-Williams brushed off a poor shooting night , driving for a layup with nine seconds remaining for the game winner . Putting his 6 - for - 17 performance from the field aside , he posted 15 points , nine assists , five rebounds , and one block . Tony Wroten nearly matched Carter-Williams off the bench , recording 20 points ( 6 - 17 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) , nine dimes , four rebounds , and two steals . Prior to the opening tip , coach Brett Brown exchanged Henry Sims for K.J . McDaniels in the starting five , and the latter responded with a modest 10 points , three rebounds , two blocks , and one assist in 33 minutes . The Sixers will next take the court Tuesday against the Minnesota Timberwolves . Meanwhile , the Pacers ' bottom - tier offense upheld the standard set this season , hitting only 33 percent from the field , including a disastrous 4 - for - 18 from three - point range . David West led the way with 28 points and nine rebounds , but after putting his side ahead with a 12 - foot jumper with 18 seconds remaining , his evening ended with a missed 13 - footer as the final horn sounded . His frontcourt mate , Roy Hibbert , only garnered 19 minutes one night removed from logging 35 on a sprained ankle . The reduced run did n't afflict his output , though , as he accrued seven points , 13 rebounds , and two blocks . On the injury front , C.J . Miles left for good after suffering an eye abrasion with 42 seconds left in the first quarter , which allowed starting shooting guard Rodney Stuckey to pick up more minutes ( 35 ) than his typical 27 per game .

Despite trotting out a less than optimum starting lineup , Atlanta cruised to an easy victory in Philadelphia . Al Horford led the way with his first career triple - double as he torched Philadelphia for 21 points , 10 rebounds , and ten assists . Over the course of his career , The Hawks are 46 - 14 when Horford has 20 points and 10 rebounds in a game . Atlanta rested three of its usual starters on Tuesday so that Jeff Teague , Paul Millsap , and DeMarre Carroll could be fresh for Wednesday 's game in Boston . The Hawks ' reserves thrived , however , with big performances from Kent Bazemore , Denis Schroder , and even a double - double from Shelvin Mack . Atlanta has now won 23 of its last 25 games , including a franchise - record nine straight road wins . Philadelphia kept the game competitive early on , but was unable to keep up with the red - hot Hawks . Guard Tony Wroten left the game in the fourth quarter with a right knee sprain and did not return . The 76ers will travel to Toronto on Wednesday for the second half of a back - to - back set .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

Philadelphia has lost 12 straight games to start the season . While that 's a deplorable situation to be in regardless of the situation , it 's in no way a surprise that the Sixers have n't been able to pull off a win . Tony Wroten started at shooting guard next to Michael Carter-Williams on Friday , an experiment the Sixers seemed to be opposed to coming into this season , and it 's a starting lineup that is unlikely to stick . K.J . McDaniels scored a career - high 17 points in 28 minutes , and the fact that he played so many minutes after commenting to the media that he is frustrated with his playing time indicates that the team did n't take much offense to his comments .

Memphis was trailing the first three quarters , and coach Dave Joerger started extending his rotation to try and find a lineup willing to fight against the 76ers ' attack . The Grizzlies waited until the fourth quarter to take the Sixers seriously , but in the fourth , Memphis went on a run to win the quarter 41 - 29 to tie the game and force overtime . The Grizzlies then continued their takeover in the extra period , winning overtime 11 - 6 to complete the win . In addition to hitting the game - tying three - pointer to send it to overtime , Mike Conley finished with 36 points in 42 minutes . They have two days off to rest before hosting the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday . Philadelphia has dropped three straight games , but the way the young team played against one of the league 's best defenses showed the promise of several of their prospects . Michael Carter-Williams attacked all night , never shying away from playing his game against an opponent that all - but assured the Sixers would take home a loss , collecting his second triple - double of the season ( 16 points , 11 rebounds , 11 assists ) . Robert Covington attacked the basket off the dribble , challenging the Grizzlies ' defense to finish with 24 points , and Hollis Thompson was deadeye from beyond the arc , finishing 5 - of - 5 on his three - point attempts . The Sixers gave the game away with their turnovers , allowing the Grizzlies to score 29 easy points off of 17 Sixers turnovers .

After a strong first half where the Cavaliers out - scored the Sixers 50 - 37 , the Sixers made a strong push in the second half and fought their way back to take a 93 - 92 lead with just under 10 seconds left in regulation after Tony Wroten converted on a layup . The Cavaliers then had a chance to take the lead with three seconds left on the clock , but Matthew Delavedova was unable to convert on a layup of his own and the Sixers then clinched with a pair of free throws to seal the deal . Philadelphia shot a superior 48 percent from the field , while Cleveland went just 39 percent from the floor . Along with making the go - ahead layup , Wroten also scored a team - high of 20 points ( 8 - 18 FG , 0 - 6 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , while adding eight assists . He 's now averaging 25 points per game over his last three outings , as he 's continued to be a consistent scoring threat off the bench for the Sixers . Michael Carter-Williams had a solid contribution of his own . He recorded his seventh double - double of the season , finishing with 18 points ( 8 - 19 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) and 13 assists . He was very successful against a young Cavaliers backcourt without the likes of Kyrie Irving . Robert Covington got the start at small forward in this one . He took advantage of the start and posted 16 points ( 4 - 9 FG , 4 - 7 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) and six rebounds in 39 minutes . He 's had a solid couple of games in a row , combining for 39 points over his last two outings . Both K.J . McDaniels and Henry Sims had 12 points apiece . The Cavaliers were without superstars LeBron James and Kyrie Irving , but were still expected to come into Philadelphia and secure the victory . Despite the loss though , Kevin Love was one of the few bright spots . He had a monster double - double , recording 28 points ( 8 - 18 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt ) and 19 rebounds . He also got to the free throw line 13 times , converting on 11 of those attempts . He 's now averaging 28 points and 11 rebounds over his last three outings , as he 's had to take it on himself to increase production with a few key members of the starting lineup sidelined . Tristan Thompson nearly had a double - double of his own and finished with 18 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 2 - 5 FT ) and nine rebounds . The only other Cavalier to reach double - digits in scoring was Joe Harris . Harris was in the starting lineup , going 6 - for - 12 from the field and 4 - for - 8 from the three - point line to score 16 points in 31 minutes . The Cavaliers ' next game will be at home against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday , while the Sixers will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

The Bucks out - shot the Sixers by a large margin in this one , going 54 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three - point line , while the Sixers went just 30 percent from the floor and a meager eight percent from beyond the arc . It was a sloppy game all - around though , as both teams turned the ball over more than 23 times . Despite shooting 18 less free throws , the Bucks still secured the 20 - point victory . The Bucks ' backcourt of Brandon Knight and Khris Middleton did the bulk of the damage in this one . Knight went 6 - for - 12 from the field and 4 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score 18 points , while also adding five assists . He 's had the hot hand lately and is averaging 21 points per game over his last five outings . Middleton on the other hand had a very efficient 18 points ( 7 - 9 FG , 2 - 2 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) of his own , but did it on the defensive side of the ball as well with five steals . The five steals were a season - high for Middleton . The Bucks did have a strong showing from their bench as well . O.J . Mayo recorded 15 points ( 6 - 11 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and six assists , while Jarryd Bayless went a perfect 6 - for - 6 from the floor to score 12 points of his own . Bayless did a little bit of everything in this game , as he also chipped in five rebounds , four assists and two steals . The Sixers had a brutal showing offensively , marked by a combined 2 - for - 25 from the three - point line as a team . They were led in scoring by rookie guard K.J . McDaniels , who went 5 - for - 8 from the field and 4 - for - 4 from the free throw line to score 14 points , while also adding six rebounds . He 's now put together a couple of solid games in a row , with 26 points over those two games . The only other starter to reach double figures in points was Nerlens Noel . Noel had 13 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 1 - 2 FT ) , five rebounds and two blocks in 28 minutes . He 's now had two blocks in three out of his last four games , continuing to make an impact on the defensive side of the ball . Michael Carter-Williams , who normally is the leader of this team , really struggled with his shot , going 1 - for - 13 from the field and 0 - for - 4 from the three - point line to finish with five points . The Bucks ' next game will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday , while the Sixers will travel to Brooklyn to play the Nets on Friday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

Facing a six - point deficit at halftime , the Sixers set themselves up for victory by outscoring the Pacers , 29 - 21 , in the third quarter , and Michael Carter-Williams brushed off a poor shooting night , driving for a layup with nine seconds remaining for the game winner . Putting his 6 - for - 17 performance from the field aside , he posted 15 points , nine assists , five rebounds , and one block . Tony Wroten nearly matched Carter-Williams off the bench , recording 20 points ( 6 - 17 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) , nine dimes , four rebounds , and two steals . Prior to the opening tip , coach Brett Brown exchanged Henry Sims for K.J . McDaniels in the starting five , and the latter responded with a modest 10 points , three rebounds , two blocks , and one assist in 33 minutes . The Sixers will next take the court Tuesday against the Minnesota Timberwolves . Meanwhile , the Pacers ' bottom - tier offense upheld the standard set this season , hitting only 33 percent from the field , including a disastrous 4 - for - 18 from three - point range . David West led the way with 28 points and nine rebounds , but after putting his side ahead with a 12 - foot jumper with 18 seconds remaining , his evening ended with a missed 13 - footer as the final horn sounded . His frontcourt mate , Roy Hibbert , only garnered 19 minutes one night removed from logging 35 on a sprained ankle . The reduced run did n't afflict his output , though , as he accrued seven points , 13 rebounds , and two blocks . On the injury front , C.J . Miles left for good after suffering an eye abrasion with 42 seconds left in the first quarter , which allowed starting shooting guard Rodney Stuckey to pick up more minutes ( 35 ) than his typical 27 per game . As the Pacers return to Indiana for Tuesday 's tilt against the Atlanta Hawks , George Hill will attempt to return from a six - game absence due to a sore left groin .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

Despite trotting out a less than optimum starting lineup , Atlanta cruised to an easy victory in Philadelphia . Al Horford led the way with his first career triple - double as he torched Philadelphia for 21 points , 10 rebounds , and ten assists . Over the course of his career , The Hawks are 46 - 14 when Horford has 20 points and 10 rebounds in a game . Atlanta rested three of its usual starters on Tuesday so that Jeff Teague , Paul Millsap , and DeMarre Carroll could be fresh for Wednesday 's game in Boston . The Hawks ' reserves thrived , however , with big performances from Kent Bazemore , Denis Schroder , and even a double - double from Shelvin Mack . Atlanta has now won 23 of its last 25 games , including a franchise - record nine straight road wins .

The Pistons will face the Houston Rockets on Saturday , and the 76ers will take on the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

After starting the season 0 - 17 , Philadelphia has played much better of late and has gone 10 - 20 over its last 30 games . While its record in that span may not jump off the page , the emergence of its young players has been encouraging . Michael Carter-Williams had his third triple - double of the season Friday , putting up 17 points , 10 rebounds , and 10 assists . Carter-Williams is now tied with Rajon Rondo for the league lead in triple - doubles . In addition , the 76ers had 16 fast break points , compared to just five such points for the Timberwolves . Minnesota was unable to close the gap late with some poor shooting and a poor defensive effort . There were some bright spots for the Timberwolves , however . Kevin Martin , in his second game back from a wrist injury , had 19 points and five assists in 30 minutes off the bench . Nikola Pekovic looked strong as well , putting up 18 points and seven rebounds . The Timberwolves will play the second half of a back - to - back set Saturday when they host the Cavaliers . Philadelphia scored over 100 points for the first time since a Dec. 13 overtime loss to Memphis . Nerlens Noel continued to be a defensive force Friday , recording six blocks to go along with 14 points and six rebounds . Friday 's win was just the third time this season Philadelphia has strung together consecutive wins . Philadelphia will wrap up its back - to - back set Saturday in Atlanta .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

The Sixers caught fire real quick in this game , out - scoring the Nuggets 61 - 40 in the first half alone . With such a huge lead at half , they were able to coast to a seven - point victory , despite a fourth quarter run by the Nuggets , as they out - scored the Sixers 30 - 20 to finish the game . The Sixers were the superior shooters in this game , going 44 percent from the field and 41 percent from the three - point line , while the Nuggets finished 39 percent from the floor and 39 percent from beyond the arc . The storyline for the Sixers in this game was the play of Hollis Thompson off the bench . Thompson went 8 - for - 12 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 23 points , while also adding three assists and two blocked shots . The 23 points were a new season - high for him and also the third straight game scoring in double figures , despite averaging only 7 points per game so far this season . After leaving Monday 's game with both a bruised shin and a sprained left ankle , Michael Carter-Williams made a suprise start . In 33 minutes , Carter-Williams recorded a double - double , finishing with 15 points ( 4 - 12 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 6 - 10 FT ) , eight rebounds and 12 assists . Many thought he would be on a minutes restriction due to his injuries on Monday , but that was n't the case , so they must not be as serious as originally thought . Robert Covington had a strong showing as well with 17 points ( 4 - 12 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 7 - 8 FT ) and eight rebounds in 29 minutes . It was his second straight impressive performance , combining for 33 points , 11 rebounds , six assists and nine steals in those two games . The Nuggets were also led by a bench player , as Danilo Gallinari scored a team - high of 22 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 10 - 11 FT ) , while also adding four rebounds in 26 minutes . It was his second night in a row with more than 10 field goal attempts , despite doing that only one other time this season , which in turn increased his point totals . Wilson Chandler also had an impressive night shooting the ball . He went 7 - for - 15 from the field and 5 - for - 10 from the three - point line to score 19 points , while adding six rebounds in only 25 minutes . He had scored 10 or less points in each of his last three games , so it was good to see him return to form . The only other starter to reach double figures in scoring was Arron Afflalo , as he finished with 14 points ( 5 - 15 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) in 29 minutes . Ty Lawson had only five points ( 1 - 4 FG , 3 - 4 FT ) , but did have a game - high of 14 assists . The Sixers ' next game will be on the road against the Boston Celtics on Friday , while the Nuggets will travel to Boston to play the Celtics on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

Philadelphia won its fourth straight home game despite being without point guard Michael Carter-Williams , who was sidelined with a foot injury . The 76ers were down by six at the half , but outscored the Hornets 28 - 13 in the third quarter to gain the lead . Charlotte 's Michael Kidd-Gilchrist went down with a hamstring injury and did not return . The Hornets were outscored by 17 after Kidd-Gilchrist left the contest . Charlotte notched two victories against Washington earlier in the week , but was unable to carry that momentum into Saturday 's contest . Lance Stephenson had a tough night from the floor , going 3 - for - 11 on field goal attempts to finish with six points in 33 minutes on the floor . Charlotte has a slim one - game lead on Miami for the seventh spot in the East , with Brooklyn and Detroit also within striking distance . The Hornets have a quick turnaround as they will host the Pacers on Sunday . Philadelphia bounced back from a 107 - 96 loss in Boston on Friday to beat a Charlotte team that had won seven of its last ten games entering Saturday . Tim Frazier moved into the starting lineup and dished out eight assists in 37 minutes of play . Robert Covington had a game - high 22 points to go with eight rebounds and a block . On the injury front , Michael Carter-Williams will work with team trainers Sunday to test out his injured foot and is considered questionable for Philadelphia 's next game , which is Monday against Golden State .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

Both teams seemed to struggle shooting the ball in this one . The Warriors went just 40 percent from the field and 24 percent from the three - point line , while the Sixers finished at 42 percent from the floor and 29 percent from beyond the arc . While the Sixers may have ended with higher shooting percentages , they turned the ball over a ridiculous 27 times , which would be hard for any team to come back from and have any chance at a victory . Stephen Curry did most of the damage for the Warriors , recording 20 points ( 7 - 20 FG , 3 - 12 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , six assists and three steals . While this kind of offensive output is expected out of Curry , he also continues to be very consistent defensively , as he 's posted two or more steals in nine out of his last ten games . Fellow backcourt superstar Klay Thompson did n't have his best outing , finishing with just 13 points ( 4 - 14 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and three assists . His field goal percentage was under 30 percent for the second straight game , as he 's seemingly struggling with his shot . He 'll look to get that dialed back in before Wednesday 's matchup with the Timberwolves . In a surprise performance off the bench , Leandro Barbosa went 5 - for - 7 from the field and 1 - for - 1 from the three - point line to finish with 16 points and six rebounds in just 19 minutes . He was very efficient with his time and could be in line for more minutes going forward . The Sixers had all five starters reach double figures in this game , although their bench did n't find as much success and combined for just 19 points . Leading the team in scoring , Robert Covington finished with 21 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 4 - 10 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) , to go along with eight rebounds and three steals . With Michael Carter-Williams out due to a toe injury , Covington became the go - to guy on the offensive side of the ball and did everything he could to keep the Sixers alive . Luc Mbah a Moute came just shy of notching a double - double , posting 13 points ( 5 - 13 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and nine rebounds in 35 minutes . He 's had a strong stretch of three games where he 's averaging 15 points and 6 rebounds , both of which are higher than his season averages up until this point .

With both teams riding their respective five - game losing streak , each were looking to get things turned around with a victory on Friday . In a surprising effort , the Sixers were able to come out victorious and end their drought . While they did n't necessarily have the best game shooting the ball , finishing at 35 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three - point line , they still shot better than the Wizards , who finished at just 32 percent from the field and a meager 24 percent from beyond the arc . Leading the way for the Sixers was Nerlens Noel , who went 5 - for - 9 from the floor and 4 - for - 6 from the free throw line for a team - high of 14 points , to go along with 13 rebounds , two steals and three blocked shots . He 's really started to get it going offensively , averaging 12 points per game over his last five . It was also his first double - double since the end of January , so it was good to see that type of production . Robert Covington was a key contributor in the win . In just 26 minutes , he posted 13 points ( 3 - 9 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) and six rebounds . He 's played well following the All-Star break , averaging 13 points and 5 rebounds over five games . Coming just short of his own double - double , Luc Richard Mbah A Moute recorded 10 points ( 4 - 9 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 0 - 4 FT ) , eight rebounds and four assists . He combined for just 12 points and eight rebounds over his previous two games , so it was good to seem him have a little more success Friday . The only other Sixer to reach double figures in points was Jason Richards , who finished with 12 points ( 4 - 9 FG , 4 - 7 3Pt ) and five assists in 26 minutes . For the Wizards , John Wall did the bulk of the damage despite the loss . He went off for 21 points ( 7 - 26 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 7 - 8 FT ) and 11 assists , notching his third double - double over his last four games . During that four game stretch , he 's averaged 13 points and 11 assists , but made just 1 - of - 10 from the three - point line over that same span , so it was n't all good for the guard . Another surprise performance came from Otto Porter , who went 8 - for - 19 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score 19 points as the starter at small forward . It was a new season - high for the forward , as he received extended playing time with Paul Pierce sitting due to a knee injury . It was his second solid showing in a row , as he 's combined for 32 points on 14 - of - 30 shooting from the floor . Coming off the bench , Ramon Sessions added 14 points ( 4 - 10 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 5 - 7 FT ) and four rebounds in 21 minutes . Considering he 's averaging just 5 points on the season , it was a nice surprise for the Wizards . Marcin Gortat chipped in with eight points ( 4 - 8 FG , 0 - 2 FT ) and 14 rebounds as well . The Sixers ' next game will be on the road against the Indiana Pacers on Sunday , while the Wizards will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Saturday . |\n",

He went 12 - for - 24 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points , while also adding nine rebounds and five assists . DeRozan also forced his way to the free throw line , and converted on a perfect 10 - of - 10 attempts . After shooting less than 30 percent over his last two games , he finally got things turned around and exploded for a new season - high in points . With Kyle Lowry sitting out on a day of rest , Greivis Vasquez started at the point , finishing with 12 points ( 5 - 8 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt ) and five assists . It was his eighteenth start of the season , as he 's now pushed his season averages to 10 points and 4 assists on the year . The Raptors also got a huge boost from their bench though .

He also added seven rebounds and two steals . Over his last three games , he 's now averaging 14 points and 11 rebounds , as he continues to improve as the season wears on .

Channing Frye posted his first double - double of the season , scoring 13 points and securing 11 rebounds . Tobias Harris continued to lead the Magic in scoring as he finished with 18 points ( 8 - 18 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and eight rebounds . He 's now scored in double figures in all five games for the Magic this season . Nikola Vucevic continued to post strong offensive numbers , chipping in 17 points to go along with five rebounds . This was the first game this season he had less than 10 rebounds . Coming off the bench , Ben Gordon went 5 - for - 11 from the field and 5 - for - 6 from the free - throw line to contribute 15 points . Tony Wroten continued his strong start to the season , finishing with 27 points and eight assists . He shot 9 - for - 16 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from the three - point line , but also comitted nine turnovers . He 's now eclipsed the 20 - point mark in four out of five games this season . Brandon Davies had the next most points for the Sixers , as he had 20 points of his own , going 9 - for - 11 from the field . Coming off the bench , rookie K.J . McDaniels played 28 minutes and turned that into 12 points ( 5 - 10 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt ) and three blocks . Uncharacteristic of a guard , he continues to provide blocks for the Sixers . Nerlens Noel had to leave after 17 minutes with a sprained left ankle and did not return . The Magic 's next game will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday , while the Sixers will play at home against the Chicago Bulls on Friday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

Phoenix is in the midst of a six - game road trip . After dropping the first game of the trip 120 - 107 to the Los Angeles Clippers , they 've rattled off three consecutive wins over some of the never - weres of the Eastern Conference . Isaiah Thomas paced the Suns on Friday . He put up 23 points and eight rebounds in 24 minutes off the bench . They 'll continue their trip Saturday in Indiana against the Pacers . Philadelphia has lost 12 straight games to start the season . While that 's a deplorable situation to be in regardless of the situation , it 's in no way a surprise that the Sixers have n't been able to pull off a win . Tony Wroten started at shooting guard next to Michael Carter-Williams on Friday , an experiment the Sixers seemed to be opposed to coming into this season , and it 's a starting lineup that is unlikely to stick . K.J . McDaniels scored a career - high 17 points in 28 minutes , and the fact that he played so many minutes after commenting to the media that he is frustrated with his playing time indicates that the team did n't take much offense to his comments . The Sixers will have a legitmitate chance at their first win of the season Saturday when they go to New York to face the Knicks .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

Boston snapped their three - game losing streak with the win . Starting center Tyler Zeller picked up two early fouls , limiting his action , but backup Kelly Olynyk filled in exceedingly well off the bench , putting up a game - high 30 points to go with nine rebounds and two blocks . Rajon Rondo played just 24 minutes , as coach Brad Stevens has turned away from Rondo at times in recent games , an interesting development when taken in the context of the Celtics ' roster on a given night , as it appears Stevens simply does n't see Rondo as capable of leading the team to a win against certain matchups . Philadelphia has dropped four straight games . They could n't get much to work offensively Monday . As a team , the Sixers shot 36 percent from the field and 14 percent from beyond the arc . Furkan Aldemir signed a four - year deal with the team Sunday and made his debut Monday , putting up two points and two rebounds in 10 minutes off the bench . Tony Wroten led the Sixers in minutes played with 30 off the bench but did not score and recorded just four rebounds and one assist . Boston will host the Orlando Magic on Wednesday . The Sixers have three days off before they 'll host the Charlotte Hornets on Friday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

On the bright side of things , the Sixers shot 45 percent from the field , 46 percent from beyond the arc and 88 percent from the free - throw line . However , as has been the case all season for the Sixers , they coughed up too many turnovers , giving up 34 easy points off of 24 turnovers .

After a strong first half where the Cavaliers out - scored the Sixers 50 - 37 , the Sixers made a strong push in the second half and fought their way back to take a 93 - 92 lead with just under 10 seconds left in regulation after Tony Wroten converted on a layup . The Cavaliers then had a chance to take the lead with three seconds left on the clock , but Matthew Delavedova was unable to convert on a layup of his own and the Sixers then clinched with a pair of free throws to seal the deal . Philadelphia shot a superior 48 percent from the field , while Cleveland went just 39 percent from the floor . Along with making the go - ahead layup , Wroten also scored a team - high of 20 points ( 8 - 18 FG , 0 - 6 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , while adding eight assists . He 's now averaging 25 points per game over his last three outings , as he 's continued to be a consistent scoring threat off the bench for the Sixers . Michael Carter-Williams had a solid contribution of his own . He recorded his seventh double - double of the season , finishing with 18 points ( 8 - 19 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) and 13 assists . He was very successful against a young Cavaliers backcourt without the likes of Kyrie Irving . Robert Covington got the start at small forward in this one . He took advantage of the start and posted 16 points ( 4 - 9 FG , 4 - 7 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) and six rebounds in 39 minutes . He 's had a solid couple of games in a row , combining for 39 points over his last two outings . Both K.J . McDaniels and Henry Sims had 12 points apiece . The Cavaliers were without superstars LeBron James and Kyrie Irving , but were still expected to come into Philadelphia and secure the victory . Despite the loss though , Kevin Love was one of the few bright spots . He had a monster double - double , recording 28 points ( 8 - 18 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt ) and 19 rebounds . He also got to the free throw line 13 times , converting on 11 of those attempts . He 's now averaging 28 points and 11 rebounds over his last three outings , as he 's had to take it on himself to increase production with a few key members of the starting lineup sidelined . Tristan Thompson nearly had a double - double of his own and finished with 18 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 2 - 5 FT ) and nine rebounds . The only other Cavalier to reach double - digits in scoring was Joe Harris . Harris was in the starting lineup , going 6 - for - 12 from the field and 4 - for - 8 from the three - point line to score 16 points in 31 minutes . The Cavaliers ' next game will be at home against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday , while the Sixers will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

It was a sloppy game all - around though , as both teams turned the ball over more than 23 times . Despite shooting 18 less free throws , the Bucks still secured the 20 - point victory . The Bucks ' backcourt of Brandon Knight and Khris Middleton did the bulk of the damage in this one . Knight went 6 - for - 12 from the field and 4 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score 18 points , while also adding five assists . He 's had the hot hand lately and is averaging 21 points per game over his last five outings . Middleton on the other hand had a very efficient 18 points ( 7 - 9 FG , 2 - 2 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) of his own , but did it on the defensive side of the ball as well with five steals . The five steals were a season - high for Middleton . The Bucks did have a strong showing from their bench as well . O.J . Mayo recorded 15 points ( 6 - 11 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and six assists , while Jarryd Bayless went a perfect 6 - for - 6 from the floor to score 12 points of his own . Bayless did a little bit of everything in this game , as he also chipped in five rebounds , four assists and two steals . The Sixers had a brutal showing offensively , marked by a combined 2 - for - 25 from the three - point line as a team . They were led in scoring by rookie guard K.J . McDaniels , who went 5 - for - 8 from the field and 4 - for - 4 from the free throw line to score 14 points , while also adding six rebounds . He 's now put together a couple of solid games in a row , with 26 points over those two games . The only other starter to reach double figures in points was Nerlens Noel . Noel had 13 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 1 - 2 FT ) , five rebounds and two blocks in 28 minutes . He 's now had two blocks in three out of his last four games , continuing to make an impact on the defensive side of the ball . Michael Carter-Williams , who normally is the leader of this team , really struggled with his shot , going 1 - for - 13 from the field and 0 - for - 4 from the three - point line to finish with five points . The Bucks ' next game will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday , while the Sixers will travel to Brooklyn to play the Nets on Friday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",
    "| 10  | January  | 2015 | Saturday  | 2014   | Wells Fargo Center        | Philadelphia | Pennsylvania | 17500      | 20500    | 17      | The Philadelphia 76ers ( 6 - 29 ) defeated the Indiana Pacers ( 15 - 23 ) , 93 - 92 , in a back - and - forth affair Saturday . Facing a six - point deficit at halftime , the Sixers set themselves up for victory by outscoring the Pacers , 29 - 21 , in the third quarter , and Michael Carter-Williams brushed off a poor shooting night , driving for a layup with nine seconds remaining for the game winner . Putting his 6 - for - 17 performance from the field aside , he posted 15 points , nine assists , five rebounds , and one block . Tony Wroten nearly matched Carter-Williams off the bench , recording 20 points ( 6 - 17 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) , nine dimes , four rebounds , and two steals . Prior to the opening tip , coach Brett Brown exchanged Henry Sims for K.J . McDaniels in the starting five , and the latter responded with a modest 10 points , three rebounds , two blocks , and one assist in 33 minutes . The Sixers will next take the court Tuesday against the Minnesota Timberwolves . Meanwhile , the Pacers ' bottom - tier offense upheld the standard set this season , hitting only 33 percent from the field , including a disastrous 4 - for - 18 from three - point range . David West led the way with 28 points and nine rebounds , but after putting his side ahead with a 12 - foot jumper with 18 seconds remaining , his evening ended with a missed 13 - footer as the final horn sounded . His frontcourt mate , Roy Hibbert , only garnered 19 minutes one night removed from logging 35 on a sprained ankle . The reduced run did n't afflict his output , though , as he accrued seven points , 13 rebounds , and two blocks . On the injury front , C.J . Miles left for good after suffering an eye abrasion with 42 seconds left in the first quarter , which allowed starting shooting guard Rodney Stuckey to pick up more minutes ( 35 ) than his typical 27 per game . As the Pacers return to Indiana for Tuesday 's tilt against the Atlanta Hawks , George Hill will attempt to return from a six - game absence due to a sore left groin .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

Despite trotting out a less than optimum starting lineup , Atlanta cruised to an easy victory in Philadelphia . Al Horford led the way with his first career triple - double as he torched Philadelphia for 21 points , 10 rebounds , and ten assists . Over the course of his career , The Hawks are 46 - 14 when Horford has 20 points and 10 rebounds in a game . Atlanta rested three of its usual starters on Tuesday so that Jeff Teague , Paul Millsap , and DeMarre Carroll could be fresh for Wednesday 's game in Boston . The Hawks ' reserves thrived , however , with big performances from Kent Bazemore , Denis Schroder , and even a double - double from Shelvin Mack . Atlanta has now won 23 of its last 25 games , including a franchise - record nine straight road wins . Philadelphia kept the game competitive early on , but was unable to keep up with the red - hot Hawks . Guard Tony Wroten left the game in the fourth quarter with a right knee sprain and did not return . The 76ers will travel to Toronto on Wednesday for the second half of a back - to - back set .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

Patterson was the Raptors ' top performer , scoring 14 points to go with 13 rebounds , six of which came on the offensive end .

DeMar DeRozan has had a tough three - game stretch that is seeing him average just 5 points and 2 rebounds in 29 minutes . He finished Friday 's game with only eight points and one rebound . Toronto is now 3 - 3 since DeRozan returned from a groin injury which he suffered on Nov. 28 . The 76ers started hot but could n't hold on in the end as execution was a major issue down the strech .

Rookie Nerlens Noel was the game - leader in the rebound category , hauling in a career - high 14 to go with 12 points .

After starting the season 0 - 17 , Philadelphia has played much better of late and has gone 10 - 20 over its last 30 games . While its record in that span may not jump off the page , the emergence of its young players has been encouraging . Michael Carter-Williams had his third triple - double of the season Friday , putting up 17 points , 10 rebounds , and 10 assists . Carter-Williams is now tied with Rajon Rondo for the league lead in triple - doubles . In addition , the 76ers had 16 fast break points , compared to just five such points for the Timberwolves . Minnesota was unable to close the gap late with some poor shooting and a poor defensive effort . There were some bright spots for the Timberwolves , however . Kevin Martin , in his second game back from a wrist injury , had 19 points and five assists in 30 minutes off the bench . Nikola Pekovic looked strong as well , putting up 18 points and seven rebounds . The Timberwolves will play the second half of a back - to - back set Saturday when they host the Cavaliers . Philadelphia scored over 100 points for the first time since a Dec. 13 overtime loss to Memphis . Nerlens Noel continued to be a defensive force Friday , recording six blocks to go along with 14 points and six rebounds . Friday 's win was just the third time this season Philadelphia has strung together consecutive wins . Philadelphia will wrap up its back - to - back set Saturday in Atlanta .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

The Sixers caught fire real quick in this game , out - scoring the Nuggets 61 - 40 in the first half alone . With such a huge lead at half , they were able to coast to a seven - point victory , despite a fourth quarter run by the Nuggets , as they out - scored the Sixers 30 - 20 to finish the game . The Sixers were the superior shooters in this game , going 44 percent from the field and 41 percent from the three - point line , while the Nuggets finished 39 percent from the floor and 39 percent from beyond the arc . The storyline for the Sixers in this game was the play of Hollis Thompson off the bench . Thompson went 8 - for - 12 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 23 points , while also adding three assists and two blocked shots . The 23 points were a new season - high for him and also the third straight game scoring in double figures , despite averaging only 7 points per game so far this season . After leaving Monday 's game with both a bruised shin and a sprained left ankle , Michael Carter-Williams made a suprise start . In 33 minutes , Carter-Williams recorded a double - double , finishing with 15 points ( 4 - 12 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 6 - 10 FT ) , eight rebounds and 12 assists . Many thought he would be on a minutes restriction due to his injuries on Monday , but that was n't the case , so they must not be as serious as originally thought . Robert Covington had a strong showing as well with 17 points ( 4 - 12 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 7 - 8 FT ) and eight rebounds in 29 minutes . It was his second straight impressive performance , combining for 33 points , 11 rebounds , six assists and nine steals in those two games . The Nuggets were also led by a bench player , as Danilo Gallinari scored a team - high of 22 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 10 - 11 FT ) , while also adding four rebounds in 26 minutes . It was his second night in a row with more than 10 field goal attempts , despite doing that only one other time this season , which in turn increased his point totals . Wilson Chandler also had an impressive night shooting the ball . He went 7 - for - 15 from the field and 5 - for - 10 from the three - point line to score 19 points , while adding six rebounds in only 25 minutes . He had scored 10 or less points in each of his last three games , so it was good to see him return to form . The only other starter to reach double figures in scoring was Arron Afflalo , as he finished with 14 points ( 5 - 15 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) in 29 minutes . Ty Lawson had only five points ( 1 - 4 FG , 3 - 4 FT ) , but did have a game - high of 14 assists . The Sixers ' next game will be on the road against the Boston Celtics on Friday , while the Nuggets will travel to Boston to play the Celtics on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

Philadelphia won its fourth straight home game despite being without point guard Michael Carter-Williams , who was sidelined with a foot injury . The 76ers were down by six at the half , but outscored the Hornets 28 - 13 in the third quarter to gain the lead . Charlotte 's Michael Kidd-Gilchrist went down with a hamstring injury and did not return . The Hornets were outscored by 17 after Kidd-Gilchrist left the contest . Charlotte notched two victories against Washington earlier in the week , but was unable to carry that momentum into Saturday 's contest . Lance Stephenson had a tough night from the floor , going 3 - for - 11 on field goal attempts to finish with six points in 33 minutes on the floor . Charlotte has a slim one - game lead on Miami for the seventh spot in the East , with Brooklyn and Detroit also within striking distance . The Hornets have a quick turnaround as they will host the Pacers on Sunday . Philadelphia bounced back from a 107 - 96 loss in Boston on Friday to beat a Charlotte team that had won seven of its last ten games entering Saturday . Tim Frazier moved into the starting lineup and dished out eight assists in 37 minutes of play . Robert Covington had a game - high 22 points to go with eight rebounds and a block . On the injury front , Michael Carter-Williams will work with team trainers Sunday to test out his injured foot and is considered questionable for Philadelphia 's next game , which is Monday against Golden State .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",
    "| 9   | February | 2015 | Monday    | 2014   | Wells Fargo Center        | Philadelphia | Pennsylvania | 16200      | 20500    | 26      | The Golden State Warriors ( 41 - 9 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 12 - 41 ) 89 - 84 on Monday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia . Both teams seemed to struggle shooting the ball in this one . The Warriors went just 40 percent from the field and 24 percent from the three - point line , while the Sixers finished at 42 percent from the floor and 29 percent from beyond the arc . While the Sixers may have ended with higher shooting percentages , they turned the ball over a ridiculous 27 times , which would be hard for any team to come back from and have any chance at a victory . Stephen Curry did most of the damage for the Warriors , recording 20 points ( 7 - 20 FG , 3 - 12 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , six assists and three steals . While this kind of offensive output is expected out of Curry , he also continues to be very consistent defensively , as he 's posted two or more steals in nine out of his last ten games . Fellow backcourt superstar Klay Thompson did n't have his best outing , finishing with just 13 points ( 4 - 14 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and three assists . His field goal percentage was under 30 percent for the second straight game , as he 's seemingly struggling with his shot . He 'll look to get that dialed back in before Wednesday 's matchup with the Timberwolves . In a surprise performance off the bench , Leandro Barbosa went 5 - for - 7 from the field and 1 - for - 1 from the three - point line to finish with 16 points and six rebounds in just 19 minutes . He was very efficient with his time and could be in line for more minutes going forward . The Sixers had all five starters reach double figures in this game , although their bench did n't find as much success and combined for just 19 points . Leading the team in scoring , Robert Covington finished with 21 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 4 - 10 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) , to go along with eight rebounds and three steals . With Michael Carter-Williams out due to a toe injury , Covington became the go - to guy on the offensive side of the ball and did everything he could to keep the Sixers alive .

With both teams riding their respective five - game losing streak , each were looking to get things turned around with a victory on Friday . In a surprising effort , the Sixers were able to come out victorious and end their drought . While they did n't necessarily have the best game shooting the ball , finishing at 35 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three - point line , they still shot better than the Wizards , who finished at just 32 percent from the field and a meager 24 percent from beyond the arc . Leading the way for the Sixers was Nerlens Noel , who went 5 - for - 9 from the floor and 4 - for - 6 from the free throw line for a team - high of 14 points , to go along with 13 rebounds , two steals and three blocked shots . He 's really started to get it going offensively , averaging 12 points per game over his last five . It was also his first double - double since the end of January , so it was good to see that type of production . Robert Covington was a key contributor in the win . In just 26 minutes , he posted 13 points ( 3 - 9 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) and six rebounds . He 's played well following the All-Star break , averaging 13 points and 5 rebounds over five games . Coming just short of his own double - double , Luc Richard Mbah A Moute recorded 10 points ( 4 - 9 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 0 - 4 FT ) , eight rebounds and four assists . He combined for just 12 points and eight rebounds over his previous two games , so it was good to seem him have a little more success Friday . The only other Sixer to reach double figures in points was Jason Richards , who finished with 12 points ( 4 - 9 FG , 4 - 7 3Pt ) and five assists in 26 minutes . For the Wizards , John Wall did the bulk of the damage despite the loss . He went off for 21 points ( 7 - 26 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 7 - 8 FT ) and 11 assists , notching his third double - double over his last four games . During that four game stretch , he 's averaged 13 points and 11 assists , but made just 1 - of - 10 from the three - point line over that same span , so it was n't all good for the guard . Another surprise performance came from Otto Porter , who went 8 - for - 19 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score 19 points as the starter at small forward . It was a new season - high for the forward , as he received extended playing time with Paul Pierce sitting due to a knee injury . It was his second solid showing in a row , as he 's combined for 32 points on 14 - of - 30 shooting from the floor . Coming off the bench , Ramon Sessions added 14 points ( 4 - 10 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 5 - 7 FT ) and four rebounds in 21 minutes . Considering he 's averaging just 5 points on the season , it was a nice surprise for the Wizards . Marcin Gortat chipped in with eight points ( 4 - 8 FG , 0 - 2 FT ) and 14 rebounds as well . The Sixers ' next game will be on the road against the Indiana Pacers on Sunday , while the Wizards will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Saturday .                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

Both teams shot surprisingly well in this one , with the Raptors finishing at 51 percent from the field and 41 percent from the three - point line , while the Sixers went 53 percent from the floor and 40 percent from deep . Despite an evenly played game , the Raptors forced the Sixers into 16 turnovers , while committing just 11 of their own , which may have made just enough of a difference to push the Raptors to a victory on the road in Philadelphia on Monday . Leading the Raptors was DeMar DeRozan , who was nearly unstoppable in this one . He went 12 - for - 24 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points , while also adding nine rebounds and five assists . DeRozan also forced his way to the free throw line , and converted on a perfect 10 - of - 10 attempts . After shooting less than 30 percent over his last two games , he finally got things turned around and exploded for a new season - high in points . With Kyle Lowry sitting out on a day of rest , Greivis Vasquez started at the point , finishing with 12 points ( 5 - 8 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt ) and five assists . It was his eighteenth start of the season , as he 's now pushed his season averages to 10 points and 4 assists on the year . The Raptors also got a huge boost from their bench though . Louis Williams went off for 21 points ( 6 - 15 FG , 2 - 9 3Pt , 7 - 7 FT ) and five assists in 30 minutes , while Patrick Patterson added 15 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) and four rebounds in 29 minutes . For the Sixers , Nerlens Noel continued with his strong play , posting 17 points on a perfect 7 - for - 7 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the free throw line . He also added seven rebounds and two steals . Over his last three games , he 's now averaging 14 points and 11 rebounds , as he continues to improve as the season wears on . Coming off the bench , Ish Smith finished with 19 points ( 8 - 13 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) , five rebounds and nine assists . It was far - and - away his best game since joining the Sixers at the trade deadline . Over his first five games since joining Philadelphia , he 's averaging 10 points and six assists . Also coming off the bench , Thomas Robinson posted an efficient 13 points ( 6 - 8 FG , 1 - 2 FT ) and five rebounds in just 14 minutes . It marked just his third time in double figures this season . Starting at point guard , Isaiah Canaan added 14 points ( 5 - 12 FG , 4 - 8 3Pt ) and three assists in 25 minutes as well . The Raptors ' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday , while the Sixers will travel to Oklahoma City to play the Thunder on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

Despite the loss , the Hawks were the superior shooters , going 39 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three - point line , while the Sixers went 37 percent from the floor and just 35 percent from deep . The Sixers did the majority of their work in the second half though , where they out - scored the Hawks 45 - 31 , helping push them to the eight - point victory in front of their home crowd . The Sixers were led by a strong bench performance from Hollis Thompson . In 30 minutes , he went 7 - for - 10 from the field and 5 - for - 7 from the three - point line to match a team - high of 19 points , to go along with nine rebounds and four assists as well . Averaging just 8 points per game on the season , it was a nice suprise for the Sixers , especially considering he had n't reached double figures in points for six straight games . Thompson received some help though , as Luc Mbah A Moute posted 19 points ( 8 - 16 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt ) of his own , while adding three rebounds and a steal . He 's turned his game up a notch lately , averaging 17 points and 6 rebounds over his last three games . Nerlens Noel was a big factor in the win as well , as he finished with 11 points ( 4 - 12 FG , 3 - 6 FT ) , 17 rebounds and five steals . The rebounds were a season - high for him , while he 's also been extremely effective on the defensive side of the ball and has posted four or more steals in each of his last three games . Starting at point guard , Isaiah Canaan added 12 points ( 2 - 13 FG , 2 - 9 3Pt , 6 - 8 FT ) , five rebounds and eight assists . In the Hawks defense , they did decide to rest three of their starters , including DeMarre Carroll , Paul Millsap and Kyle Korver , as they have already locked up a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs . With those guys out , Jeff Teague put it on himself to do the bulk of the work offensively . In 32 minutes , he finished with a team - high of 17 points ( 5 - 13 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 6 - 6 FT ) , while also recording four assists and two steals . He 's had a good start to March , averaging 19 points and 4 assists over his last three games , but it was n't enough with the majority of his supporting cast on the sideline . The Hawks also received a solid contribution off their bench though , with Dennis Schroder posting 16 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and six assists . He came in with a season average of 9 points per game on the year , but he 's shown a lot of improvement lately and has averaged 16 points and eight assists over his last four games . Both Al Horford and Mike Scott reached double figures as well , adding 12 and 11 points respectively . The Sixers ' next game will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday , while the Hawks will be at home against the Sacramento Kings on Monday .                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

With 43 seconds left in the game , Jerami Grant went to the free throw line and converted on both of his attempts to put the Sixers up by three . Aaron Brooks then went on to hit a three - pointer to tie the game at 92 with just over 30 seconds left in regulation . Luc Mbah A Moute had a shot to win it for the Sixers at the buzzer , but he missed and forced the game into overtime . Once overtime started though , the Bulls did n't look back , as they out - scored the Sixers 12 - 3 and finished the game with a nine - point win on the road in Philadelphia . Including the clutch three - point shot that helped the Bulls extend this game to overtime , Brooks also went on to post a team - high of 31 points ( 12 - 20 FG , 3 - 7 3PT , 4 - 6 FT ) , to go along with four rebounds and five assists . He has now shot over 40 percent from the field in three games straight , a stretch where he 's averaged 23 points and four assists per game . Also playing a big factor in the win was Pau Gasol . Gasol went 13 - for - 25 from the field for 27 points , while adding a team - high of 16 rebounds in 43 minutes . The double - double marked his six straight , while he 's posted 10 or more rebounds in each of his last 10 games as well . On the season , he 's pushed his averages to 18 points and 12 rebounds per game . Notching a double - double of his own , Nikola Mirotic finished with 16 points ( 5 - 13 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) and 12 rebounds as a member of the starting lineup . Joakim Noah had to sit out with an injury , forcing Gasol to move center , which opened a spot up for Mirotic at power forward . He 's combined for 34 points and 24 rebounds over his last two games . The only other Bull to reach double figures in points was Tony Snell , who recorded 10 points ( 2 - 9 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 5 - 7 FT ) and 10 rebounds in 45 minutes . With Isaiah Canaan dealing with an illness , the Sixers decided to bring him off the bench , while inserting Ish Smith as a starter . It was a successful switch for this team , as each scored 20 or more points despite the loss . Smith went off for 23 points ( 9 - 21 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and six assists in 37 minutes . The points were a new season - high for the guard , as it marked just the fourth time he 's reached double - digits in points . Canaan , on the other hand , went 7 - for - 15 from the field and 4 - for - 8 from the three - point line for 20 points in 29 minutes off the bench , as his illness did n't seem to limit him much . While his season averages sit at 8 points and 2 rebounds per game , he 's received many more opportunities since joining the Sixers at the trade deadline . Over 10 games with the Sixers , he 's averaging 14 points and 4 assists . Nerlens Noel did n't do all too much offensively and posted just eight points , but he did chip in with 15 rebounds , four steals and two blocked shots in 36 minutes . Coming off the bench , Robert Covington added 12 points ( 5 - 13 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 1 - 3 FT ) in 21 minutes off the bench . The Sixers ' next game will be at home against the Sacramento Kings on Friday , while the Bulls will travel to Charlotte to play the Hornets on Friday . |\n",

After being out - scored by 20 points in the second quarter , the Sixers had themselves in a hole , as they were down 64 - 51 at the half . They came out with a big third quarter though , where they out - scored the Kings 37 - 18 to give them just enough of a lead to secure the seven - point win in front of their home crowd . While both teams are likely going to miss the playoffs , it was still a nice win for the Sixers , who notch just their fifteenth victory of the season . The Sixers did n't have the best night shooting the ball , but they still finished at 47 percent from the field and 28 percent from the three - point line as a team . Robert Covington led the way , scoring 24 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 6 - 12 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) , to go along with two assists and three steals . It was the most points he 's scored since the beginning of February , as he matched a season - high in hitting six three - point shots.Covington did receive some help though , as Nerlens Noel finished with 16 points ( 7 - 13 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) , 12 rebounds and a blocked shot . Noel remains inconsistent with his scoring , but continues to dominate the boards and has grabbed double - digit rebounds in seven of his last eight games . He 's averaging 9 points and 8 rebounds on the season . The Sixers also got some help from the bench from rookie Jerami Grant . Grant went 5 - for - 7 from the field to score 13 points , while also adding two steals and four blocked shots in 29 minutes . He had gone a combined 1 - for - 7 from the field over his last two games , so it was good to see him get things turned around . Ish Smith added 10 points ( 3 - 11 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , five rebounds and nine assists off the bench as well . Despite taking the loss , DeMarcus Cousins had himself a monster game . Cousins went 12 - for - 24 from the field and 15 - for - 20 from the free throw line to score a game - high of 39 points , while also grabbing 24 rebounds in the process . Cousins continues to play well of late , as this was his fifth straight double - double . Over that five - game stretch , he 's averaging 25 points and 16 rebounds , as he 's one of the hottest players in the league . Rudy Gay also did his best in keeping the Kings close . In 40 minutes on the court , Gay finished with 24 points ( 7 - 17 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 9 - 10 FT ) and four rebounds . Like Cousins , he 's played extremely well over his last five games , averaging 28 points during that span , while shooting over 40 percent in each of those matchups as well.The only other King in double figures was Derrick Williams , who came off the bench for 15 points ( 5 - 9 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and three rebounds in 31 minutes . The Sixers ' next game will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday , while the Kings will travel to Washington to play the Wizards on Saturday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

The 76ers were able to pull off the win despite Nerlens Noel leaving the game with a right foot contusion after playing just 22 minutes . He had 11 points on 5 - of - 10 shooting , four rebounds and three blocks in that time and did not return . It was Ish Smith who led the way for Philadelphia , as he was moved into the starting point guard role while Isaiah Canaan was moved to the bench . Smith thrived in the role , recording 15 points on 6 - of - 12 shooting , eight assists and three steals in 26 minutes . Canaan struggled coming off the bench , putting up just nine points on 2 - of - 10 shooting and four assists in 22 minutes . Jason Richardson shot his way out of a slump , scoring 15 points on 4 - of - 7 shooting in 25 minutes , as it was just the first time in five games that Richardson scored in double figures . Conversely , Robert Covington struggled , as he shot just 1 - of - 6 from the field on his way to three points in 22 minutes off the bench . Thomas Robinson and Jerami Grant were able to make positive contributions in their reserve roles , scoring 12 and 10 points respectively . The win is just Philadelphia 's third in 10 games , and they currently boast the third worst record in the NBA . It was a quick fall back to reality for the Pistons , as just a day after upsetting the Grizzlies and ending a 10 - game losing streak , they lost to one of the NBA 's worst teams . They were without Greg Monroe , who sat out his second consecutive game with a strained knee . Despite the loss , Detroit did have some strong performances . Reggie Jackson followed up Tuesday night 's big game with a triple - double , putting up 11 points on just 4 - of - 17 shooting , 11 rebounds and 10 assists in 32 minutes . Kentavious Caldwell-Pope also followed up his 24 - point performance on Tuesday in a strong way , scoring 20 points on 7 - of - 16 shooting and grabbing eight rebounds in 36 minutes . Beyond those two , the Pistons struggled , as no other Detroit player scored in double figures . By losing 11 of their previous 12 games , they are destined for the NBA lottery . Up next , the 76ers will take on the Knicks at home Friday , while the Pistons head home Saturday to take on the Bulls .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

The Clippers were led by DeAndre Jordan , who put up another stellar performance , he finished with 17 points , 20 rebounds and two blocks . He 's been the leading rebounder in every Los Angeles game dating back to Feb. 21 . His play has helped lead them to six straight victories , three of which were on the road . Austin Rivers has seen an increase in minutes recently , most likely because the Clippers have been on the winning end of a couple blowouts , but it never hurts to be the coach 's son . He played 24 minutes against Philadelphia and scored 13 points to go along with five rebounds and three assists . Nerlens Noel continued his streak of improved play as of late . He went for 30 points and 14 rebounds against a tough Clipper 's interior defense . Over his past five games he 's averaging 18 points , 12 rebounds , 3 blocks and 2 steals . Much better than his season averages of 10 points , 8 rebounds , 2 blocks and 2 steals . Ish Smith seems to have found a home in the Philly starting lineup , for the time being . He had 18 point and 9 assists against Los Angeles . The Sixers will look to tie their season high for wins in a month when they take on the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday , but are much more likely to take a victory against the Lakers on Monday . Doc Rivers will bring his team to Boston to take on his former team the Celtics on Sunday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

Washington shot a very impressive 65 percent from the field and 53 percent from three , and the victory moves them just one game behind both the Bulls and Raptors as they look to make a late push for third place in the Eastern Conference . Robert Covington had a great shooting night and led the way for the 76ers in the losing effort , posting 27 points ( 8 - 11 FG , 4 - 6 3Pt , 7 - 8 FT ) in just 24 minutes and was the only Philadelphia starter to reach double figures on the night . Jason Richardson also had an efficient performance , scoring 17 points ( 6 - 7 FG , 4 - 5 3Pt ) in 21 minutes off the bench . Thomas Robinson scored 11 points and was the only other 76er to score in double figures , but he also added 12 rebounds to give himself a double - double on the night . The team shot a woeful 35 percent from the field , but the loss does help Philadelphia in their quest for the No . 1 overall pick , as they continue to boast the third worst record in the league . Up next , the Wizards will travel to Brooklyn Friday to play the Nets , while the 76ers will head to Chicago and go up against the Bulls on Saturday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

The Bucks continued to gain some steam as the regular season winds down , notching their third straight victory and finishing the season sweep over the Sixers . They 've already locked up the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference standings , so this was another solid momentum builder for the playoffs that start this coming Saturday . The game did get somewhat chippy towards the end though , as both Jerryd Bayless and O.J . Mayo received technical fouls for the Bucks , while Jakaar Sampson picked one up for the Sixers . The Bucks were the superior shooters in this game , going 49 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three - point line , while the Sixers finished at 40 percent from the floor and just 21 percent from deep . Michael Carter-Williams had another strong showing , finishing with 30 points ( 11 - 17 FG , 8 - 13 FT ) , five rebounds , five assists and three steals . Over his last four games , he 's averaged 23 points , six assists and 3 steals , so the Bucks would love to see him stay this hot going into their playoff series with either the Toronto Raptors or Chicago Bulls . Giannis Antetokounmpo had a solid overall game as well , recording 12 points ( 3 - 9 FG , 6 - 10 FT ) , seven rebounds and three assists over 34 minutes . He 'll take season averages of 13 points and 7 rebounds into the Bucks ' final matchup on Wednesday . The only other two players to reach double figures in points were Ersan Ilyasova and O.J . Mayo . Ilyasova finished with 13 points ( 5 - 8 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and three steals , while Mayo posted 13 points ( 5 - 9 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , four rebounds and three steals of his own . The Sixers were led by the duo of Robert Covington and Hollis Thompson . Covington went 6 - for - 13 from the field , but just 1 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 25 points , while also adding seven rebounds and four blocked shots . It was n't all good for the forward though , as he turned the ball over a whopping 10 times . He 's played well over these final games other than the turnovers , averaging 24 points over his last three . Thompson , on the other hand , finished with 19 points ( 7 - 18 FG , 3 - 10 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and four rebounds over 36 minutes . Thompson shot less than 40 percent from the field in three of his last four games coming into this one , so it was a step in the right direction Monday with his performance . Thomas Robinson and Jakaar Sampson finished in double figures off the bench . Robinson posted 12 points ( 4 - 8 FG , 4 - 6 FT ) and six rebounds , while Sampson had 10 points ( 3 - 8 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and five rebounds . The Bucks ' regular season will come to an end at home against the Boston Celtics on Wednesday , while the Sixers will be at home against the Miami Heat on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

With both teams having already been eliminated from the playoffs , this game was more about giving the young and inexperienced players a chance to make an impression on the coaching staff in hopes of coming back with their team next season in a bigger and better role . As a team , the Heat finished at 44 percent from the field and 39 percent from the three - point line , while the Sixers went 46 percent from the floor but just 18 percent from deep . The Heat rested nearly their whole team in this game , with just six players seeing the court and four players not coming out of the game even once . Michael Beasley was one of those players who played the full 48 minutes Wednesday as a starter . He went off for a game - high of 34 points ( 12 - 27 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 10 - 11 FT ) , to go along with 11 rebounds and eight assists in a near triple - double effort . They were season - highs across the board for Beasley , who had n't even broken the 20 - point mark yet this season . James Ennis also had a huge game , filling up the stat sheet like Beasley . Over 48 minutes , he recorded 17 points ( 7 - 20 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) , 12 rebounds and six assists , marking one of his best games of the season as well . Averaging just 5 points , 3 rebounds and 1 assists per game over the course of the season , this was a great finish for the forward . Both Zoran Dragic and Henry Walker were in the starting lineup as well and put up some points . Dragic finished with 22 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and two steals , while Walker chipped in with 21 points ( 6 - 10 3Pt , 3 - 5 FT ) and four rebounds . Despite taking the loss , the Sixers still had some impressive performances of their own . Jakarr Sampson stood out once again . He recorded a team - high of 22 points ( 8 - 15 FG , 0 - 5 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) , while also adding five rebounds and six assists . Sampson has seen extended time here at the back end of the season , as he 's averaged 17 points and 6 rebounds over his last three games . Robert Covington really struggled with his shot , but got to the free throw line enough to score 19 points ( 4 - 14 FG , 2 - 9 3Pt , 9 - 10 FT ) , to go along with four rebounds and two blocked shots . After shooting over 40 percent from the field and scoring more than 20 points in his previous three games , this was somewhat of a let - down performance for Covington in the season finale . The Sixers also received a ton of production off their bench from the likes of Hollis Thompson and Thomas Robinson . Thompson finished with 19 points ( 8 - 15 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt ) and four assists , while Robinson ended with 13 points ( 5 - 7 FG , 3 - 3 FT ) and 10 rebounds . With both teams failing to make the playoffs , this marks the end of their respective seasons .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

Playing without Joakim Noah ( illness ) , Chicago once again turned to Taj Gibson to fill the void . And for the second straight night , Gibson did not disappoint . After scoring 16 points in Tuesday 's win over Orlando , Gibson hung 23 points and 10 rebounds on the Bucks in a game - high 44 minutes . Pau Gasol added 22 points and 14 boards , and Jimmy Butler chipped in 13 points , six rebounds and seven assists . Derrick Rose , who missed Tuesday 's contest , scored just 13 points to go with seven assists and four turnovers . The Bulls shot 47 percent from the field and 73 percent ( 22 - of - 30 ) at the free throw line . Milwaukee , looking for its first winning streak since the 2012 - 13 season , led by four at halftime but came out flat in the third quarter , allowing Chicago to regain the lead entering the final period . The teams traded baskets for most of the fourth , and a Giannis Antetokounmpo dunk - his third of the quarter - brought the Bucks to within one with 5:31 remaining . The Bulls would make a run , however , capped by a Kirk Hinrich corner three - pointer with 2:15 remaining that put Chicago up 88 - 80 . The Bucks would never get back to within six , and the Bulls were able to salt the game away at the free throw line . Antetokounmpo , affectionately known as `` The Greek Freak , `` led the way for Milwaukee , scoring 13 points ( 6 - 11 FG ) in 27 minutes off the bench to go with eight boards . Khris Middleton added 11 points in 23 minutes , and Brandon Knight chipped in 10 points , 9 rebounds and seven assists as the only other Bucks player in double - figures .

The Thunder just ca n't seem to get the ball rolling right now , but it 's understandable since they 're currently without two of the best players in the NBA in Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook . Reggie Jackson and Serge Ibaka did everything they could , with Jackson scoring 29 points ( 12 - 21 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) , to go along with four rebounds , four assists , two steals and one block , and Ibaka posting 14 points ( 4 - 13 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , with seven rebounds , two assists and one block . In the end though , the Bucks just had more bench proudction which allowed the Bucks to stop the Thunder from stealing a road win . Oklahoma City now heads to Boston to take on the Celtics on Wednesday . The Bucks may have only had one player score in double figures from their starting lineup in Brandon Knight , who scored 16 points ( 6 - 15 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 5 FT ) , with four assists , four rebounds and one steal , but the bench picked up the slack . Milwaukee had 53 bench points in this game , and were led by 19 points ( 6 - 15 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 5 - 7 FT ) and four rebounds from O.J . Mayo . Giannis Antetokounmpo also had a big night , nearly posting a double - double , with 14 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 2 - 4 FT ) , and nine rebounds . The Bucks will look to get above .500 on Friday night when they head on the road to Orlando to play the Magic .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

The Pistons continued with their season struggles against the Bucks on Tuesday , as they suffered their fifth loss in a row and now sit at the bottom of the Eastern Conference , above only the lowly Philadelphia 76ers . The Bucks were able to out - score the Pistons 30 - 19 in the third quarter , setting themselves up for the victory . They also out - rebounded the Pistons 50 - 36 , giving them even more of an advantage . The Bucks were led by Brandon Knight , who despite being questionable to play with a quad injury , took the court and recorded 20 points ( 7 - 12 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and eight assists . He 's now combined for 47 points in the last two games , as he has found his shooting stroke as of late . O.J . Mayo was in the starting lineup at shooting guard for the first time this season . He capitalized on his opportunity as he shot 5 - for - 10 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 17 points . He 's averaging only 11 points on the year , so the promotion into the starting lineup may have provided him some extra motivation . Larry Sanders and Jabari Parker both played well in the victory and were big reasons for the rebound advantage . Sanders had 12 points and nine rebounds , while Parker had 14 points and nine rebounds . The Bucks have been a surprise this season and will look to continue with their momentum . Despite the loss , the Pistons were led by a double - double from center Andre Drummond who scored 23 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in 32 minutes . He has now recorded 10 or more rebounds in an impressive 11 of 14 games this season . Greg Monroe came two rebounds shy of his own double - double , and he finished the game with 15 points and eight rebounds . With Brandon Jennings sitting out , D.J . Augustin was the starter at point guard . He shot 4 - for - 11 from the field and 1 - for - 1 from the three - point line to score 11 points , while handing out seven assists . The Pistons ' bench struggled to offer any help , as they had only 20 of the 86 total points . The Bucks ' next game will be on the road against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday , while the Pistons will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

It was the second victory over Miami for the Bucks this season after emerging victorious in Miami 91 - 84 on Nov. 16 . Milwaukee fell behind early but clawed back into the game in the second quarter and held a four - point advantage at half . The lead grew to eight at the end of the third quarter , and the Bucks blew the game open in the final period , outscoring Miami by 15 in the fourth . The Bucks were led by an unlikely face in Kendall Marshall , who scored a season - high 20 points ( 7 - 8 FG , 4 - 5 3Pt ) in 24 minutes . Brandon Knight had 13 points , five rebounds and three assists , while Jerryd Bayless added 12 points off the bench . Jabari Parker , Giannis Antetokounmpo ( 8 - 11 FT ) , and Khris Middleton each finished with 14 points . Milwaukee shot nearly 57 percent from the field and knocked down 9 - of - 16 three - point attempts . Miami got solid performances from its two stars , as Chris Bosh ( 21 points ) and Dwyane Wade ( 28 ) combined for 49 points , nine assists and nine boards . They did n't receive much help , though , as no other Heat player scored in double - figures . Mario Chalmers had nine points , six assists and six steals , while Danny Granger finished with seven points and five fouls . James Ennis led the bench with seven points in 24 minutes . Next up , the Bucks play host to the Mavericks on Saturday in the second meeting in four days between the two teams . Miami travels to Memphis to take on the Grizzlies on Sunday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

Milwaukee capped their two - game losing streak with the win . The Bucks shot 57 percent from the field and 64 percent from beyond the arc , dissecting the Clippers ' defense quite masterfully . Brandon Knight scored a team - high 22 points , and the Bucks had six players finish in double figures . The Bucks have been wading through a tough stretch of their schedule that will continue as they embark on a four - game Western Conference road trip Monday against the Phoenix Suns . Los Angeles has dropped two straight games . Prior to their most recent losses , the Clippers went on a nine - game win streak in what will probably prove to be the easiest stretch of their schedule this season . Confronted with more top - level teams , the Clippers have buckled , and with Spencer Hawes ( knee ) sitting out Saturday , they lacked depth in the frontcourt , putting an even greater onus on their starting lineup . Chris Douglas-Roberts returned from a 17 - game absence with an Achilles injury to play six minutes off the bench . Matt Barnes scored a game - high 26 points , and Chris Paul turned the ball over six times in what was an all - around obtuse game for the Clippers . They 'll look to end the protraction of their losing streak when they host the Detroit Pistons on Monday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

Charlotte has won four straight games , and while the wins have come during an easy part of their schedule ( Sixers , Jazz , Nuggets , Bucks ) , the talking heads have tried to fit the narrative of Lance Stephenson ( groin ) sitting out as the reason for the Hornets ' success . Stephenson has missed the last four games , coinciding with the Hornets ' resurgence , and while they have no doubt played remarkably better of late , putting all the blame on one player is misleading . Kemba Walker led with the way Tuesday , putting up a team - high 27 points in 36 minutes . Charlotte will go on the road to face the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday . Milwaukee has dropped two straight and three of their last four games as they struggle to try and fill the hole of Jabari Parker ( knee ) being out for the rest of the season . Brandon Knight tried his best to keep the Bucks in a position to win , putting up a game - high 34 points in 34 minutes .

Playing on the second night of a home - and - home back - to - back between these two teams , the Hawks came into Saturday 's game looking for revenge after they took a beating at the hands of the Bucks 107 - 77 on Friday , and they got their revenge . Atlanta jumped out to a 21 - 10 lead after the first quarter . They gave up most of their lead in the second quarter but had enough to hang on for the win . Jeff Teague paced the team with a game - high 25 points in 37 minutes , indicating that he is probably over his hamstring injury . The Hawks shot a putrid 37 percent from the field but were able to secure the win by holding the Bucks to an unremarkable 39 percent shooting from the field and by getting 32 easy points on 19 turnovers by the Bucks . Milwaukee was playing without Ersan Ilyasova ( concussion ) and Larry Sanders ( illness ) , leaving them inadequately supplied to deal with the strength and skill of Al Horford and Paul Millsap . Khris Middleton found success off the bench , putting up a team - high 21 points in 37 minutes . The Bucks will continue their road trip against the Charlotte Hornets on Monday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

Despite the Bucks finishing the third quarter up 68 - 66 , the Pacers were able to out - score Milwaukee 28 - 23 in the final quarter to secure a close three - point victory in a tough conference road game . While both teams finished at 43 percent from the field , the Pacers were better from the three - point line , as they shot 40 percent from deep , while the Bucks shot just 29 percent . Roy Hibbert was a force in this one , as the Bucks did n't have much of an answer for him . Hibbert went 6 - for - 11 from the field and a perfect 6 - for - 6 from the free throw line to score 18 points , while also adding seven rebounds . Hibbert is only averaging 11 points so far this season , so it was good to see him heat up a little bit against a mostly inexperienced Bucks front line . The Pacers did receive a couple of big contributions off the bench . Leading all scorers , C.J . Miles went 8 - for - 14 from the field and 6 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score 22 points in 32 minutes . He 's now combined for 47 points over the last two games , as he 's taken it upon himself to give the Pacers another proven scorer . Luis Scola also had an efficient game off the bench . He had 14 points ( 7 - 9 FG , 0 - 2 FT ) and five rebounds in only 17 minutes . The only other Pacer to reach double figures in points was Rodney Stuckey , who had 11 points . The Bucks were led by Brandon Knight , as he went 9 - for - 19 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 20 points , while also adding seven assists and four steals . Knight continues to be one of the more reliable offensive threats for the Bucks and has now combined for 46 points over his last two outings . He 's averaging 18 points and 5 assists on the year . Zaza Puchilia did everything he could to combat Hibbert . Pachulia finished with a double - double , posting 12 points and 14 rebounds . It was only his third double - double of the year . Also with a double - double , John Henson came off the bench for 14 points and 10 rebounds . Henson was very efficient as he did this in only 23 minutes . It was arguably his best game of the year considering he set season - highs in both points and rebounds . The Pacers ' next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday , while the Bucks will travel to New York to play the Knicks on Sunday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

    "| 14  | February | 2017 | Tuesday   | 2016   | Target Center             | Minneapolis    | Minnesota      | 17700      | 19000    | 3558    | The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 116 - 108 Tuesday at Target Center . The Timberwolves ( 21 - 35 ) managed to keep pace with the East-leading Cavaliers ( 38 - 16 ) for a majority of Tuesday 's contest , and they were well within striking distance down the final stretch of the game . That was until LeBron James hit a step back three - pointer with two minutes remaining to take his team 's lead from three points to six . At that point , Minnesota was finished . James finished with 25 points on an efficient 10 - of - 14 shooting from the field to go along with 14 assists and eight rebounds as the Cavaliers walked out of the Target Center with their second straight victory and their sixth win in their last seven games . Kyrie Irving added 25 points of his own , Channing Frye posted a double - double of 21 points and 10 rebounds as Kevin Love 's replacement and the newest Cavalier , Derrick Williams , came off the bench to score 13 points Tuesday . As for those Timberwolves , a brilliant performance from Andrew Wiggins ended up not being enough for a team that has lacked a strong supporting cast all season . After scoring 20 points in the third quarter , Wiggins finished the game with 41 points on 16 - of - 29 shooting from the field . Karl-Anthony Towns had yet another productive night as well , scoring 26 points and grabbing eight rebounds , but besides those two , Minnesota failed to get much else offensively from their team . Ricky Rubio did manage to dish out a game - high 16 assists and grab eight rebounds , but he was n't able to produce enough in the scoring column , ending with just five points on 2 - of - 8 shooting from the field . Up next , the Cavaliers will look to continue to build on their lead in the Eastern Conference on Wednesday against the Pacers , while the Timberwolves will travel to Denver on Wednesday to take on the Nuggets .This season , Ricky Rubio has proven to be a crucial member of Minnesota 's offense with no legitimate backup point guards and now without the services of Zach LaVine ( knee ) . However , while Rubio has been putting up big - time assist numbers as of late , he remains a liability scoring - wise . Tuesday 's performance was yet another example for the Spaniard , as he posted a game - high 16 assists , which was his highest total since he dished out 17 on Jan. 11 against the Rockets . And while Rubio did an adequate job of getting his teammates involved , he struggled to get himself involved , scoring just five points on 2 - of - 8 shooting from the field . This was n't an aberration for the point guard either , as it was the seventh time this season that Rubio was able to record double - digit assists but not reach double - digit points .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

It was a big night for two Blazers in particular , as center Jusuf Nurkic and guard C.J . McCollum combined for 72 points for Portland ( 36 - 38 ) . Nurkic contributed a career - high scoring output of 33 points to go along with a whopping 16 rebounds and three blocks . The output came against his former team , from whom he was traded at the deadline . Nurkic was absolutely deadly from the field , shooting 12 - of - 15 from the field and 9 - of - 11 at the free - throw line . McCollum , meanwhile , shot 15 - of - 24 for a game - high 39 points . The two were the centers of a red - hot Blazers offense , as the team shot over 49 percent from the field and reached the line 33 times on the night . Denver ( 35 - 39 ) , meanwhile , saw slightly more balanced production from their scorers . Six Nuggets scored in double figures , and their own young big man nearly recorded a triple - double . Sophomore center Nikola Jokic cleaned up , recording 17 points , eight rebounds , and eight assists . However , the team simply could not slow down the two hot scorers for Portland . Foul trouble proved problematic as well , as the Nuggets got to the line 20 times but gave up 33 free - throws to Portland . The game was hugely impactful on the playoff standings , as Portland was able to pass Denver for eighth in the conference thanks to the win . Portland will host Houston on Wednesday , while Denver will visit Charlotte on Thursday .It was a huge night for Portland 's young stars , and in particular , recently acquired big man Jusuf Nurkic . Nurkic had a career - high 33 points on 12 - of - 15 shooting and 9 - of - 11 at the free - throw line against his former team . Offense was n't the only thing Nurkic provided , though , as he pulled down a whopping 16 rebounds to go along with two steals and three blocks . The young center continues to grow in his new starting role with Portland . Nurkic was not even his team 's high scorer , however , as shooting guard C.J . McCollum exploded for 39 points . McCollum shot 15 - of - 24 from the field and splashed home three three - pointers on the night . In addition , McCollum had five rebounds , three assists , and went 6 - of - 6 at the free - throw line . For Denver , young big man Nikola Jokic made an impact with 17 points , eight rebounds , and eight assists . Veteran starter Jameer Nelson also contributed somewhat surprisingly with a team - high 23 points on the night .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

Despite both teams having already been eliminated from playoff contention , this still marked a hard fought game between these Western Conference rivals . The Kings came out as the superior shooters in this one , going 53 percent from the field and 38 percent from the three - point line , while the Timberwolves finished at 48 percent from the floor and just 32 percent from deep . Also helping push the Kings to a win was their rebounding , as they finished with a 49 - 36 advantage . With DeMarcus Cousins sidelined because of a foot injury , it was Rudy Gay and Omri Casspi who really stepped up and had huge games . Gay finished with 33 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 13 - 15 FT ) , seven rebounds and five assists , while Casspi posted 31 points ( 12 - 20 FG , 4 - 6 3Pt , 3 - 5 FT ) and five rebounds . Casspi had far - and - away his best performance of the season , as he 's really picked it up lately . Over his last four games , he 's averaging 20 points , while shooting an impressive 57 percent from the field . Gay , on the other hand , is on fire as well , combining to go 19 - of - 35 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from deep for 57 points over his last two outings . He 's now pushed his season averages to 21 points and 6 rebounds per game on the season . Coming off the bench , Derrick Williams had a strong showing as well . He went 8 - for - 12 from the field to score 18 points , while adding eight rebounds over 31 minutes as well . The 18 points matched a season - high for the forward , as it was one of his better outings of the year . Despite being unable to limit the Kings ' offense , the Timberwolves nearly pulled off the victory due to some strong offensive performances of their own . Kevin Martin had the most impressive line , finishing with 37 points ( 13 - 31 FG , 3 - 11 3Pt , 8 - 11 FT ) and eight assists . It was a season - high in field goal attempts for the guard , who had a slightly better performance than he did on Friday , where he went just 3 - of - 12 from the field . He 's now averaging 20 points on the season and will continue to get off a ton of shots due to the vast amount of injuries the Timberwolves are dealing with . Rookie Andrew Wiggins had a big game as well though , recording 26 points ( 11 - 20 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) and eight rebounds . He 's posted 20 points or more in seven of his last eight games , as he 's done his best to help Martin pick up the slack of those sitting out . Zach LaVine was the other big contributor . In 40 minutes , he finished with 21 points ( 9 - 18 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) and 11 assists , marking just the second double - double of his career . The Kings ' next game will be on the road against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday , while the Timberwolves will travel to Portland to take on the Trail Blazers on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

Houston got out to a fast start , taking a commanding 44 - 18 lead by the 11 - minute mark in the second quarter . The Thunder cut the Rockets ' lead to 10 early in the fourth , but Houston answered with a 120 run to effectively close out Oklahoma City . Houston ended the game shooting 47 % from the floor , but was shooting above 50 % for much of the contest . Oklahoma City came out flat after a long rest , having last played on Friday against Utah . Things wo n't get much easier for the Thunder , who host the Warriors on Friday before going on a five - game road trip next week against the likes of the Wizards and Hawks . Oklahoma City is now three and a half games behind Phoenix for the eighth seed in the West . Houston has now won both games against Oklahoma City this season , although Thursday 's contest was drastically different than the 69 - 65 game in November where both teams shot under 30 % from the floor . Point guard Patrick Beverley , who suffered a knee contusion Wednesday , was able to play 32 minutes and finished with 13 points and five rebounds . James Harden finished one rebound shy of a triple - double as he dropped 31 points , 10 assists , and nine rebounds on the Thunder .

Both teams came into the game with notable changes to their respective starting lineups . Atlanta ( 24 - 17 ) gave Dwight Howard the afternoon off for rest , which slid Paul Millsap over to center and Thabo Sefolosha to power forward , as Mike Muscala was unavailable due to an ankle injury suffered Sunday . Meanwhile , the Knicks ( 18 - 24 ) replaced Courtney Lee with Ron Baker at the two - guard spot , and brought Mindaugas Kuzminskas into the starting five as well with Lance Thomas unavailable due to a broken orbital bone and possible concussion brought about by a Jonas Valanciunas elbow a day prior . Carmelo Anthony shifted to power forward in place of Kristaps Porzingis , who was once again absent due to his sore Achilles . The personnel shifts did n't affect the quality of play in the least , and in fact , may have enhanced it . The two teams engaged in an entertaining back - and - forth battle that was n't decided until the final seconds , when a Joakim Noah shot attempt failed to find the net . Dennis Schroder , who had endured a rough couple of games coming in to Monday , had given the Hawks what would be their final margin of victory with a 25 - foot three - pointer jumper with 22 seconds remaining . A revitalized Schroder led Atlanta with 28 points overall , a total he supplemented with three rebounds and three assists . Tim Hardaway , Jr. checked in second with 20 points , four assists , three rebounds and a steal . Millsap was effective at the five , posting 17 points , seven rebounds , six assists , three steals and three blocks . Kent Bazemore followed up a strong Sunday showing with 16 points , six rebounds , five assists and a steal . Kris Humphries got extra run off the bench with Muscala out and led the second unit with 14 points , seven boards , an assist and a steal . The Knicks were paced by Carmelo Anthony , who went off for 30 points , seven rebounds , two assists and a steal . Derrick Rose followed with a near double - double consisting of 18 points , nine assists , four rebounds , a steal and a block . Kuzminskas supplied 14 points , five rebounds , two assists and a pair of steals . Noah registered a modest seven points but hauled in 17 boards , while also providing three assists , two blocks and a steal . Justin Holiday led the bench with 11 points and four rebounds . The Hawks continue on the road and next head to the Motor City , where they 'll face the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night . The Knicks make the short trip to Boston to tangle with the Celtics that same evening .Dennis Schroder 's 28 points led the Hawks , and his three - pointer with 22 seconds remaining ended up being the game - winning basket .

Kent Bazemore followed with 16 points , and Kris Humphries led the second unit with 14 points . Carmelo Anthony 's 30 points led New York , and Derrick Rose followed with a near double - double consisting of 18 points , nine assists , four rebounds , a steal and a block .

Midway through the third quarter , it looked like the Warriors were going to run away with the game , maintaining a double - digit lead through the first six or so minutes . However , the Clippers were able to make a run late in the quarter to take a one - point lead into final period . From there , it was the Stephen Curry show . While Los Angeles managed to keep it close through the final 12 minutes , they simply had no answer for last year 's MVP . Curry scored 13 points in the fourth quarter and finished with 31 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 7 - 11 3Pt ) for the game in 33 minutes . Harrison Barnes also came up big in the fourth quarter , scoring 10 straight points at one point and finishing with a team - high nine rebounds in 36 minutes . Klay Thompson 's clutch free throws put the game out of reach , and his block on Jamal Crawford in the closing seconds sealed the deal . He finished with 16 points in 32 minutes . For the Clippers , Chris Paul and Blake Griffin did everything they could to keep their team in the game , but in the end , it just was n't enough .

It was a gritty game , with both teams shooting 43 percent or worse from the floor . The Raptors pulled away from the Spurs thanks to their work at the free - throw line . DeMar DeRozan led the charge there , marching to the line to convert 10 - of - 12 attempts . The Spurs could n't buy a shot , shooting 33 percent from the field and 25 percent from beyond the arc . Tim Duncan and Marco Belinelli tied for a team - high 12 points , illustrating the Spurs ' futility on offense . Toronto is in second place in the Eastern Conference , but they sit seven games behind the conference - leading Hawks . The Raptors will host the Wizards on Wednesday .

    "| 21  | November | 2015 | Saturday  | 2015   | American Airlines Arena   | Miami          | Florida        | 19700      | 19600    | 1567    | The Miami Heat ( 8 - 4 ) held off the Philadelphia 76ers ( 0 - 14 ) to win 96 - 91 on Saturday . This was the Sixers best chance at a win all season , but they could n't quite hold off the Heat . Miami ended the game on a 20 - 4 run and held the Sixers to one basket over the final seven - plus minutes . Not to mention , that one basket was a meaningless one with just seconds left in the game . The Heat held the Sixers to 38 percent shooting and blocked 14 shots in the win . Philadelphia 's bench was a bright spot though , as they outscored Miami 's bench 47 to 26 . This was a rough loss in a disastrous season for Philadelphia . They had a big lead early , but simply could n't hold on . They did get two great bench performances , as Robert Covington dropped 21 points while Isiah Caanan dropped 22 points . Philadelphia 's best player on this night was rookie Jahlil Okafor , who tallied 16 points , 11 rebounds and three steals en route to a double - double . The rookie now leads the team in scoring and is second on the team in rebounding . They might have their best chance at a win when they take on the equally - young Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday . The Heat looked horrible in the first half , but leaned on their stifling defense to pull out a big win . Miami got an outstanding performance from Dwyane Wade , who tallied 27 points , seven rebounds , four assists and three steals in the victory . Hassan Whiteside also had a great game , as he collected 13 points , nine rebounds and eight blocks in the win . Those eight blocks add to his already league - leading total and he 's truly playing at a different level this season than years past . This is one of the best defenses in the NBA right now and they showed why on Saturday . Miami will look to keep up their strong defense against the surging New York Knicks on Monday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

After being out - scored by 20 points in the second quarter , the Sixers had themselves in a hole , as they were down 64 - 51 at the half . They came out with a big third quarter though , where they out - scored the Kings 37 - 18 to give them just enough of a lead to secure the seven - point win in front of their home crowd . While both teams are likely going to miss the playoffs , it was still a nice win for the Sixers , who notch just their fifteenth victory of the season . The Sixers did n't have the best night shooting the ball , but they still finished at 47 percent from the field and 28 percent from the three - point line as a team . Robert Covington led the way , scoring 24 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 6 - 12 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) , to go along with two assists and three steals . It was the most points he 's scored since the beginning of February , as he matched a season - high in hitting six three - point shots.Covington did receive some help though , as Nerlens Noel finished with 16 points ( 7 - 13 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) , 12 rebounds and a blocked shot . Noel remains inconsistent with his scoring , but continues to dominate the boards and has grabbed double - digit rebounds in seven of his last eight games . He 's averaging 9 points and 8 rebounds on the season . The Sixers also got some help from the bench from rookie Jerami Grant . Grant went 5 - for - 7 from the field to score 13 points , while also adding two steals and four blocked shots in 29 minutes . He had gone a combined 1 - for - 7 from the field over his last two games , so it was good to see him get things turned around . Ish Smith added 10 points ( 3 - 11 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , five rebounds and nine assists off the bench as well . Despite taking the loss , DeMarcus Cousins had himself a monster game . Cousins went 12 - for - 24 from the field and 15 - for - 20 from the free throw line to score a game - high of 39 points , while also grabbing 24 rebounds in the process . Cousins continues to play well of late , as this was his fifth straight double - double . Over that five - game stretch , he 's averaging 25 points and 16 rebounds , as he 's one of the hottest players in the league . Rudy Gay also did his best in keeping the Kings close . In 40 minutes on the court , Gay finished with 24 points ( 7 - 17 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 9 - 10 FT ) and four rebounds . Like Cousins , he 's played extremely well over his last five games , averaging 28 points during that span , while shooting over 40 percent in each of those matchups as well.The only other King in double figures was Derrick Williams , who came off the bench for 15 points ( 5 - 9 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and three rebounds in 31 minutes . The Sixers ' next game will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday , while the Kings will travel to Washington to play the Wizards on Saturday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

Daye played 19 minutes and finished with six points . Matt Bonner , who started the Spurs ' opener at center did not get off the bench against the Suns . Alex Len played a career - high 32 minutes and finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds to record the first double - double of his NBA career . Len did his damage off the bench , while starting center Miles Plumlee played just 15 minutes , a development that does n't mean much in the course of one game , but after the Suns invested a fifth - overall pick in the 2013 NBA Draft on Len , his development is something they 're going to be keen to push , and that may come at the expense of Plumlee at some point . Isaiah Thomas lead the Suns with a team - high 23 points off the bench . The Spurs have four days off before their next game at home Wednesday against the Atlanta Hawks . The Suns will finish a back - to - back set on the road Saturday against the Utah Jazz .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

The Lakers injury problems suffered a few more setbacks before the game wrapped up , as Kobe Bryant ( achilles ) left midway through the game to nurse his nagging achilles and rookie Larry Nance Jr. left with knee soreness after just three minutes of playing time . The beat up Lakers squad is far from an excuse for their play halfway through the season and the offensive miscues only add to their troubled year . Developing the young talent combination of Jordan Clarkson , Julius Randle and D'Angelo Russell does not seem to be the number one priority with the Kobe Bryant retirement tour in full swing , and the wasted experience will take its toll . Los Angeles turned to Lou Williams to score in volume , but managed 20 points on 15 shots and fell short of what was needed for his team to keep the game within reach at any point . Jordan Clarkson and D'Angelo Russell joined Williams in scoring double figures . The Lakers will look to get their 10th when they host the Houston Rockets ( 21 - 20 ) on Sunday . Utah has been experiencing a fair share of injury troubles as well , with both Trevor Booker ( concussion ) and Derrick Favors ( back ) , sidelined on Saturday . Favors missed his 13th consecutive game , and it is still unclear if their is another issue or if the Jazz are taking his return slowly . Rudy Gobert led the way with a monstrous performance , scoring 18 points , grabbing 18 rebounds and blocking five shots in 30 minutes . Gordon Hayward contributed 14 points , five rebounds and five assists , while four additional Jazz players finished in double figures ( Trey Lyles , Rodney Hood , Trey Burke and Joe Ingles ) in a strong team effort . Utah shot 49 percent from the floor and kept the game out of reach from the Lakers from the 2nd quarter on . Utah continues to battle for the 8 - seed in the Western Conference , and will look to pick up another win when they visit the Charlotte Hornets ( 18 - 22 ) on Monday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

Sacramento has won two straight games . They 've had a terrific start to the season and have n't shown any signs of slowing down . While DeMarcus Cousins ' line of 31 points and 18 rebounds is no great shock due to the frequency in which he put up such amazing lines , Ben McLemore 's 22 points and nine rebounds gave McLemore the best game of his young career . Even retread Derrick Williams got in on the funk train Saturday against his former team . Williams put up 12 points and six rebounds in 30 minutes . The Kings continue their road trip against the Pelicans in New Orleans on Tuesday . Minnesota has lost two straight and seven of their last eight games . Injuries can be blamed for the depth of the Timberwolves ' struggles this season , but they were never considered a team with much of a shot at a playoff spot in the stacked Western Conference . An argument could be made that the injuries the Timberwolves continue to suffer are a blessing in disguise considering that it 's forcing the team to give their young talent run against top - flight teams . Andrew Wiggins scored a career - high 29 points in 41 minutes Saturday . Mo Williams helped Wiggins get those points . Williams finished with 11 points and 12 assists for his second double - double in the last three games . The Timberwolves have three days off before hosting the Milwuakee Bucks on Wednesday . By Wednesday 's game , the Timberwolves expect to have Thaddeus Young ( personal ) and Nikola Pekovic ( wrist ) back in the active lineup .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

This game was simply a tough one for the 76ers , as they lost by 32 points , and could n't get much to go their way . They were without Nerlens Noel ( ankle ) in this one , and while the bench managed to score 44 points , the starters could n't all do their part . The team was led in scoring by Tony Wroten with 18 points ( 6 - 16 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 5 - 7 FT ) , and he chipped in five assists , three rebounds and a steal as well . Philadelphia also got solid production from big man Henry Sims with 12 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) , eight rebounds , three assists and one steal . The 76ers are off until Thursday , when they head to Dallas to take on the Mavericks and Dirk Nowitzki . The Raptors on the other side saw production come from all over the place , including deep into the bench . A total of 11 players scored for Toronto , and 13 players saw time on the court .

Julius Randle , alongside the Lakers youth , led the charge with an impressive all around performance against the Heat . Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade faced off for the last time , and the Staples Center energy was alive and well given the improvement Randle and D'Angelo Russell have shown through the past few week . Wade still has the clutch gene , and with 23 seconds left in overtime , he drove the lane and finished at the rim to tie the game at 100 points a piece , but Randle took what the defense gave him and showed off a filthy crossover - spin move combo , which led to the game winning floater with 2 seconds on the clock . D'Angelo Russell may be dealing with some disturbances in the locker room , but he was instrumental in the overtime period , as he scored on back - to - back possessions , even with the Miami Heat clawing back and finding a way to answer the Lakers surge . Kobe Bryant exited the game before the end of the first half and it was listed as general soreness . Jordan Clarkson led all scorers and provided needed free throws in the fourth quarter . The sophomore guard finished with 26 points , six rebounds and one assist , while Julius Randle added his 33rd double - double of the season with 13 points and 14 rebounds . Wade matched Clarkson 's 26 points , and added 10 rebounds and five assists to round out the box score , but it was Hassan Whiteside 's monstrous 18 points , 17 rebounds and seven blocks that stuck out the most . The Heat were thin in terms of the roster , and Whiteside technically came off the bench even though he registered 38 minutes of action . Luol Deng looked to bust out of his scoring slump , and provided 22 points and 11 rebounds in the loss , although the veteran is averaging his lowest point total since his rookie year . The Heat will head north and face the Sacramento Kings ( 30 - 45 ) on Friday , while the Lakers will enjoy a few days off before hosting the Boston Celtics ( 43 - 31 ) on Sunday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

This game meant much more to the Bulls than Bucks and it was evident by the result . The second quarter is when Chicago made their mark , as they outscored Milwaukee 33 to 17 . The shooting was on point for the Bulls , as they made 53 percent of their shots and assisted on 30 of their 39 made baskets . This win brings the Bulls within two games of the eight - seed in the east , so it was obviously a crucial win . Jimmy Butler once again carried the torch , as he scored a team - high 25 points and also provided five rebounds and eight assists . Pau Gasol flirted with a triple - double , as he accumualted 16 points , eight rebounds and eight assists . Nikola mirotic gave the team a nice spark off the bench with 19 points and six rebounds . Up next for Chicago is a matchup with the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday . Milwaukee has been dominant at home , but these meaningless games are tough to get up for . Giannis Antetokonmpo was clearly game though , as he scored a game - high 34 points , while dishing out nine assists and grabbing five boards .

The Warriors clinched the Western Conference long ago and at this point were just trying to stay healthy for the playoffs . In a somewhat meaningless game for Golden State , no starter played more than 20 minutes , and no bench players saw the floor for more than 25 minutes . Despite playing just 16 minutes , Klay Thompson managed to lead the Warriors with 25 points on 8 - for - 12 shooting from the field and 5 - for - 7 from downtown . Golden State will take on the New Orleans Pelicans ( 45 - 37 ) when the playoffs commence this weekend . The Nuggets ended a second straight disappointing season with a loss to the top - seeded Warriors .

Anthony Davis had a special game , in which he led his team in all five major statistical categories . He had 24 points , 11 rebounds , five assists , six blocks and two steals in a do - it - all performance . His play brought his team to the winner 's circle with a much needed victory to keep his team ahead of the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference playoff race . The Pelicans have the same record as the Thunder , but hold the tie - breaker and would be admitted into the playoffs if the teams wind up with identical records . The Timberwolves had a rough second quarter and could n't quite climb out of the hole against New Orleans . They went into halftime down by 15 after trailing the Pelicans by two heading into the second . Zach LeVine led Minnesota with 24 points and seven assists to go along with five rebounds for the rookie . Decimated by injuries , the Timberwolve 's frontcourt was manned heavily by Justin Hamilton , Adreian Payne and Arinze Onuaku . Those three combined for 18 points and 12 rebounds . Chase Budinger and Robbie Hummel helped pick up the slack . They had 29 points , 18 rebounds and five assists combined . Minnesota needs a win and a New York Knicks loss to avoid being the sole team with the worst record in the NBA this season . Minnesota will end their rebuilding year in Oklahoma City against the Thunder , as the Pelicans will travel to San Antonio to take on the Spurs on Wednesday . Each game has massive playoff implications . The Thunder need a win and a Pelicans loss . If the Pelicans win they secure the eighth seed . However , the Spurs are playing for the second seed in the Western Conference and likely wo n't rest their star players .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

Meanwhile , the red - hot Cavs will look to stretch their streak to seven games as they take on the Jazz on Tuesday in Cleveland .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

The high - scoring affair was a testament to the reigning NBA champs ' ability to pull out a victory in almost any style of game . While the Warriors can certainly grind teams down with defense - - demonstrated Wednesday night when holding the Grizzlies to 85 points - - they 've also shown they can withstand a prolific offense performance from their opponent and still prevail . The latter was the case Thursday , with the Timberwolves getting productive nights out of multiple starters and reserves , yet still suffering a disheartening double - digit loss . Steph Curry led all scorers with 46 points on 15 - for - 25 shooting . It marked Curry 's second - highest scoring night of what is already an MVP-caliber season , and the 60 percent accuracy from the field was his third highest this season . Curry drained eight three - pointers on the night , tying a season high , at an impressive 62 percent clip . The remaining four Warriors starters also scored in double digits , led by Draymond Green 's 23 - point , 12 - rebound double - double . The Warriors are in first place in both the Pacific Division and Western Conference , sporting the best record in the league . They head home for a Saturday night tilt versus the Brooklyn Nets . The Timberwolves posted their second - highest scoring night of the season after 117 points in a surprising victory over the Hawks on Monday . Minnesota received double - digit scoring performances from starters Andrew Wiggins ( who returned from a one - game absence due to a knee injury ) , Zach LaVine ( who replaced the injured Ricky Rubio ) and rookie sensation Karl Anthony-Towns , who posted his fourth consecutive double - double and sixth overall on the season . The reserves also got in on the fun , led by Shabazz Muhammad ( 16 points ) and Kevin Martin ( 15 points ) . Backup center Gorgui Dieng and 17 - year veteran Andre Miller contributed a pair of 11 - point efforts . The Timberwolves dropped to 4 - 4 on the season and are in a three - way tie with the Utah Jazz and Denver Nuggets for second place behind the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They head to Indiana for the second game of a back - to - back versus the Pacers .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

The second game of a back - to - back for the Lakers proved to be a heavy workload , as the team looked tired throughout the second half . Kobe Bryant ( shoulder ) started , but only played the first half , likely to give the crowd a sendoff in his final game in Denver . It was far from a pretty showcase between the two teams , but the Lakers received another strong performance from rookie point guard D'Angelo Russell , who scored 24 points on 9 - of - 21 shooting , to go along with one rebound and six assists in 36 minutes . Russell has broken through in the second half of the season , and heading into Wednesday , he had posted a five game stretch averaging 21 points , 4 rebounds , 5 assists on 55 percent shooting . That stat line is the lone bright spot for Los Angeles aside from Brandon Bass ' defensive improvement over the last 10 games . Bass added 11 points on 4 - of - 7 shooting off the bench , but helped bring his team within striking distance of the Nuggets down the stretch , forcing a couple of turnovers and defending both the paint and wing at an exceptional level . Bryant five points in 10 minutes of game time , while Julius Randle fell short of a double - double with 17 points and seven rebounds . The Lakers will host the Atlanta Hawks ( 33 - 28 ) on Friday . The Nuggets held on to win , but it looked bleak after surviving an eight minutes stretch of play between the third and fourth quarters where they scored an underwhelming two points . Denver shot 1 - of - 12 during that stretch , and save for the Lakers inability to rebound the ball , the eight minute stretch could have been extended . The unlikely hero came on the back of D.J . Augustin , who rallied the Nuggets after the scoring drought and finished with 26 points , seven rebounds , five assists and one steal on 7 - of - 11 shooting in 23 minutes off of the bench . Emmanuel Mudiay put together a strong game , and the rookie matchup with Russell made for the most entertainment , as he rounded out the box score with 22 points , four rebounds and seven assists on 10 - of - 20 shooting . Gary Harris , Nikola Jokic and Kenneth Faried all finished in double figures in their starting roles . The Nuggets will host the Brooklyn Nets ( 17 - 44 ) on Friday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

The Hornets ' prized offseason acquisition , Nicolas Batum , left Wednesday night 's contest versus the Magic with an illness . That same malady extended into Thursday , opening up the starting opportunity for Jeremy Lin . The six - year pro had his best scoring game in over two years , tallying a game - high 35 points on outstanding 13 of 22 shooting from the field . The total included a pair of three - pointers , and was amassed over a robust 47 minutes . Lin 's previous scoring high on the season was 19 points , but the 27 - year - old showed that he is still highly capable of a breakout performance when given extended opportunity . The player who had considerable trouble defending Lin , DeMar DeRozan , nevertheless had a stellar offensive showing of his own . The Raptors ' shooting guard collected a team - high 31 points and added five assists , four rebounds , a steal and a block . The outing was DeRozan 's fifth consecutive game with 20 or more points . His trusty backcourt mate Kyle Lowry pitched in with 20 points , but needed an astounding amount of shot attempts to get there . Lowry was an atrocious 6 of 29 from the field , including 3 for 17 from beyond the arc . Bismack Biyombo and Terrence Ross both provided solid contributions , with the former accumulating a season - high 18 rebounds ( along with eight points ) , and the latter pouring in 17 points on the strength of a season - high five three - pointers . The Raptors fell to 16 - 11 but remain in first place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head to Miami to take on the Heat on Friday . Kemba Walker was the second member of the Hornets ' backcourt to spearhead Charlotte 's offensive attack , supporting Lin 's effort with 27 points of his own . He added seven assists , six rebounds , a pair of blocks and a steal . Marvin Williams contributed a 10 - point , 10 - rebound double - double , while P.J . Hairston pitched in with a second straight 14 - point performance that included a season - high four three - pointers . One of those long - range buckets came with 1:30 left in the overtime period and gave the home team a lead they would not relinquish . Spencer Hawes was highly productive off the bench , collecting a modest five points but hauling in an impressive 10 boards . He added four assists , three steals and a block in a highly efficient 23 minutes of action . The Hornets improved to 15 - 10 and currently reside in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They head to Washington for a Saturday night showdown with the Wizards .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

West put up 18 points and six rebounds in 24 minutes . Luis Scola moved back to a bench role with West healthy , playing 22 minutes off the bench . C.J . Watson ( foot ) also made his season debut , putting up nine points and four assists in 18 minutes off the bench . The Pacers will kick off a four - game road trip Saturday against the Cleveland Cavaliers . Orlando has dropped four straight games , including the first game of the six - game road trip they began in Indiana on Friday . The Pacers beat them on the boards , held them to 44 percent shooting from the field and also foced the Magic into 18 turnovers . Orlando 's roster got healthy over the last few games , and it seems their talent is having trouble finding out how to play together , though that should iron itself out as the season progresses . The Magic will take on the Suns in Phoenix on Sunday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

These days , it seems as if the Wizards ca n't buy a victory . Losers of three straight entering Saturday 's contest , Washington was trying to bounce back on their home court after enduring a 33 - point loss to the Celtics on Friday in which they 'd mustered a season - low 78 points . Although their offensive output was barely any better versus the Raptors , the Wizards had ridden an outstanding defensive effort to a 68 - 62 lead entering the final quarter . During that fourth period , the Raptors benefited from the hot shooting stroke of offensive linchpin Kyle Lowry , who scored eight of his game - high 27 points during that span and helped close the deficit to a razor - thin 82 - 81 with three seconds remaining . Then , on Toronto 's final possession , it was DeMar DeRozan who alertly was able to feed Cory Joseph in the left corner for a game - winning three - point shot as time expired . Lowry sunk six three - pointers as part of his offensive barrage , and kicked in seven rebounds , three assists , a pair of steals and a block in a highly productive 34 minutes against the normally stout defense of John Wall . In addition to his game - winning assist , DeRozan pitched in with 23 points after a slow first half , and added three rebounds and two assists . The performance marked the third consecutive game the standout shooting guard has scored 20 points or more . The rest of the Toronto starters were notably quiet with respect to points , but Bismack Biyombo provided what was likely one of the most productive scoreless outings in NBA history by hauling in 16 boards ( 15 on the defensive glass ) , and posting four blocks , a pair of assists and a steal . Joseph paced the Raptors ' bench with nine points , including his game - winning bucket from beyond the arc . Notably , Toronto escaped with the win despite committing 22 turnovers and having a slightly better shooting percentage from three - point range ( 46 ) than from the field ( 43 ) . The Raptors improved to 11 - 6 and currently have sole posession of first place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Divison . They head home for a date with the Phoenix Suns on Sunday . The Wizards once again were hampered by a lack of overall offense , despite the fact that four of their starting five tallied double - digit scoring nights . Bradley Beal led the way with a 20 - point effort that also featured six rebounds , six assists and three steals over 41 minutes . The boards equaled a season - high for Beal , while the assists were his second - best total on the year in that category . John Wall was able to contribute 18 points and supplement it with three rebounds , five assists and three steals . Marcin Gortat pitched in with a 16 - point , 10 - rebound double - double , while Otto Porter poured in 13 points . The sole holdout in single digits was spot starter Jared Dudley , who tallied seven points , four rebounds and two assists while taking Kris Humphries ' place in the lineup . The Wizards ' reserves could offer no help on this night however , with Humphries ' four points representing the bench 's highest scoring output . Washington fell to 6 - 8 and currently resides in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They head to Cleveland to face the Cavs on Tuesday .                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

Orlando was able to stay in the game through the first half , but Cleveland jumped out to a commanding 16 - point lead after outscoring the Magic 33 - 21 in the third quarter . Kevin Love had another solid game , draining six 3 - pointers and finishing with a game - high 34 points . The Cavaliers had perhaps their best shooting performance of the season , hitting 51 percent of their attempts from downtown ( 18 - of - 35 ) . It 's been an up - and - down season for Magic point guard Elfrid Payton , who went 0 - for - 7 from the field and finished with zero points in 19 minutes . With Payton the bench for most of the game , Shabazz Napier posted a season - high nine assists with 11 points over 29 minutes . The silver lining for Orlando was the play of power forward Andrew Nicholson , who scored a season - high 18 points off the bench . The Magic rotation has been very unpredictable lately with so many starters struggling , so that will likely mean more opportunities for guys like Napier and Nicholson moving forward . With the win , Cleveland kept it 's undefeated record at home in tact . In his second straight start in place of the injured Timofey Mozgov , Tristan Thompson registered a game - high 14 rebounds and came a point shy of a double - double for another night in a row . J.R. Smith continues to improve in each game and turned in a season - high 26 points ( 10 - 16 FG , 6 - 10 3Pt ) . LeBron James took a night off from scoring and decided to distribute a bit more , dishing out 13 assists as the Cavaliers put on a passing clinic finishing with 34 dimes . The Cavaliers get a tough test on the road Wednesday against the Raptors ; the Magic get the Knicks at home .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

Golden State has won 15 straight games , and in their last two games , they 've done it without starting center Andrew Bogut who has been sidelined with tendinitis in his knee . David Lee ( hamstring ) is nearing a return but has yet to be cleared to return to action , and even when Lee does return , there does n't seem to be more than a marginal role off off the bench available to him . Stephen Curry led the way with a game - high 29 points Saturday , and he was helped by Draymond Green and Klay Thompson , who both also finished with 20 - plus points . Golden State is playing a back - to - back set . They 'll continue their road trip Sunday in New Orleans against the Pelicans . Bogut had fluid drained from his knee and will sit out Sunday . Dallas is playing through a relatively tough part of their schedule at the moment , and while they 've been able to successfully dispatch middling teams , the Mavericks have n't been able to overcome most of the other title - contending teams they 've faced , recently dropping games to the Phoenix Suns and Memphis Grizzlies . As a result they 're just 2 - 3 over their last five games . Chandler Parsons suffered a back injury Tuesday but then played through the injury Wednesday . Even with two days off , he was rested Saturday , and Richard Jefferson was given the spot start at small forward in Parsons ' absence . Jameer Nelson returned after a one - game absence with a shoulder injury . Nelson returned to the starting lineup and played 28 minutes . Dallas has two days off before going on the road to face the New York Knicks .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

The second half of the Southeast Division rivals ' home - and - home series turned out to be a fitting encore for Sunday 's thriller , although Orlando looked like an improbable victor early in Monday 's contest . The Hawks jumped out to a quick 30 - 18 lead after one quarter , with Al Horford 's six points during the period leading the way . However , the Magic hung around during the middle periods , and entered the final 12 minutes facing a 83 - 72 deficit . In the last 14 seconds of regulation , Orlando 's fortunes were affected by the highs and lows that come with young players ' growing pains . First , rookie Mario Hezonja was the momentary hero , draining a clutch 26 - foot three - point jumper with 14 seconds remaining that finally gave the Magic a lead by the razor - thin margin of 101 - 100 . Three short seconds later , second - year forward Aaron Gordon fouled Paul Millsap , bringing the Hawks ' trusty veteran to the foul line . Millsap sunk his first free throw to tie the game at 101 , and then blocked Victor Oladipo 's nine - foot jumper with one second remaining to send the game into overtime . In the extra period however , Nikola Vucevic took matters into his own hands , scoring seven of the Magic 's first nine points to stake them to a 112 - 107 lead they would n't relinquish . Although Atlanta got as close as 112 - 110 after Kyle Korver 's three - pointer with 50 seconds remaining , Evan Fournier answered with his own trey at the 31 - second mark to extend Orlando 's lead back to five . Vucevic proved to be a Hawk killer for the second straight day on the stat sheet , amassing a team - leading 28 points , and adding 13 rebounds , six assists and a block . Elfrid Payton provided a very well - rounded stat line himself with 20 points , seven assists , four rebounds , three steals and a block . Fournier contributed 16 points overall , and also supplied four assists , three rebounds and three steals . Gordon chipped in with his second double - double in as many nights , recording 12 points , hauling in 10 boards , dishing out three assists and also recording a steal and a block . Jason Smith and Hezonja paced the bench with 14 points apiece . Smith also posted an assist , two steals and four blocks , while Hezonja added a career - high nine rebounds and three assists . The Magic are currently in a third - place tie with the Washington Wizards in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They head back home to await the San Antonio Spurs for a Wednesday tilt . Horford essentially matched Vucevic point - for - point , collecting 27 of his own and adding six rebounds , three assists and a pair of blocks . Millsap managed his first double - double since Jan. 27 , tallying 19 points , 13 rebounds , six assists , a block and four steals . Jeff Teague continued a recent stretch of resurgent offensive play with 21 points , five assists , three rebounds and a steal . Korver pitched in 16 points overall , including four of his trademark three - pointers . He also had a trio of boards , four assists and a pair of steals . Despite consecutive losses , Atlanta remains in a first - place tie with the Miami Heat atop the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They head to Chicago to take on the Bulls on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

The win coincidentally ended a seven - game win streak for OKC . Brooklyn sits at fourteenth in the Eastern Conference , leading only the league - worst Philadelphia 76ers ; however , they were able to come away with a win against one of the association 's stronger teams on Sunday . The Nets have been skidding all season , seeing coach Lionel Hollins fired and GM Billy King tender his resignation . On Sunday , they ended a slough of tough losses , advancing their record to 8 - 17 at home on the season . Star big man Brook Lopez caught fire on Sunday , pouring in a team - high 31 points while pulling down 10 rebounds . OKC defensive anchor Steven Adams sat out Sunday 's contest with an injured right elbow , allowing Lopez to take advantage of the defensive shortcomings of backup Enes Kanter . Lopez was aided , however , by the hustle of power forward Thaddeus Young . The veteran pulled down seven offensive rebounds and 14 boards in total , also notching 14 points , three assists , a block , and a steal . For Oklahoma City , the loss comes as a bit of a shock considering the tear that the team had found itself on . The Thunder boast the third - best record in the NBA , trailing only the historically good Warriors and Spurs . For Oklahoma City 's dynamic duo of superstars , Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant , it was business as usual on Sunday . The two combined for 59 points , 22 rebounds , and 14 assists . Both players were named starters for the Western Conference in this year 's All-Star game earlier this week . However , outside of the superstar tandem , only two Thunder players cracked double - digit scoring , recording 10 points apiece . OKC was edged out at the line and on the glass , as they allowed the Nets to pull down 18 offensive boards and 49 in total . The Thunder will try not to let the loss affect them as they travel to Madison Square Garden on Tuesday to take on the Knicks . The Nets , meanwhile , will play host to the Miami Heat on Tuesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",

George Hill will not play this weekend as he continues to work his way back from a groin injury , putting his return on tap for Monday 's game against the Rockets as his earliest possible return date .

In just 25 minutes on the floor Monday , Paul was able to improve all of those figures , going 4 - of - 6 from three and 8 - of - 11 overall , grabbing five steals , and turning the ball over just once . On top of that , Paul scored a team - high 21 points and dished out nine assists . It was another solid outing for the Clippers ' Blake Griffin as well , as the forward scored 20 points while grabbing six rebounds and recording six assists . On the opposing side , Nets ' guard Bojan Bogdanovic stepped into a leading role for the shorthanded Nets ' offense . Bogdanovic led the team with 18 points on 8 - of - 11 shooting . Former No . 1 overall pick Anthony Bennett did not enjoy the same success , however , as he shot just 2 - of - 8 from the field .The host Los Angeles Clippers demolished the Brooklyn Nets , 127 - 95 , at Staples Center on Monday night . The Clippers ( 10 - 1 ) became the first team to reach 10 wins on the season with Monday 's victory , and have made quick work of most teams on their run . One of the key factors to their success has been its league - best defense , which was on full display against Brooklyn . The Clippers held their opponents to 44 percent shooting and forced 21 turnovers on the night . Big man Mo Speights provided an extra defensive boost for LA , recording two steals and three blocks off the bench . Defense was n't the only story , however , as the Clippers were able to score a ridiculous 127 points on 53 percent shooting . Point guard Chris Paul led the offense with 21 points and nine assists , while All-Star power forward Blake Griffin trailed not far behind with 20 points and six assists . Los Angeles was able to score seemingly at will from beyond the three - point line , as the team shot 56 percent from three - point range . Brooklyn ( 4 - 6 ) , meanwhile , was bitten with the injury bug prior to the contest . Point guard Jeremy Lin ( hamstring ) as well as backup Isaiah Whitehead ( concussion ) were sidelined , while star center Brook Lopez was given the game off to rest . The absence of key players did the Nets no favors , as the team struggled mightily on both ends of the floor . Former No . 1 overall pick turned D-League call - up , Anthony Bennett was forced to play 26 minutes , shooting just 2 - of - 8 during that stretch . The game was put out of reach for Brooklyn almost immediately , as Los Angeles took a 39 - 14 lead in the first quarter . The Nets will stay at Staples Center to play the Lakers on Tuesday , while the Clippers will host the Grizzlies on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

In a back - and - forth contest , Indiana was able to outscore Orlando 25 - 14 in the final frame to draw even at .500 on the season . Paul George scored 19 of his 27 points in the first half and added seven assists and four rebounds in 36 minutes . The Magic had another tough time scoring down low with center Nikola Vucevic sidelined for the third straight game because of a knee injury . Jason Smith was also out with a knee injury of his own . With two important forwards on the skids , Orlando employed Channing Frye , who finished 4 - of - 9 from distance with 14 points and eight rebounds in 23 minutes . Evan Fournier has gotten back on track after struggling against Toronto last Friday , pouring in 21 points with four treys in 40 minutes . George has given Pacers ' fans something to get excited about , looking better and better every game . He 's averaging just over 30 points per game and has three double - double 's over his last four contests . George Hill remained one of the hottest shooters in the NBA , scoring 23 points and hitting four from downtown to provide Indiana with plenty of secondary scoring behind George . Guard Rodney Stuckey briefly left the game due to an ankle injury , but was able to return finishing with just six points in 18 minutes . The Magic head home to take on the Lakers on Wednesday , while the Pacers will travel to Boston for a date with the Celtics .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

It was a close game heading into the final quarter , but Atlanta outscored the Nets 29 - 17 in the fourth to improve to 5 - 1 . After losing their opening contest , the Hawks have gone on a five - game winning streak . Their biggest question heading into the season was how they 'd replace Demarre Carroll , who fled to Toronto in free agency . They filled his position with Kent Bazemore , who has been successful early on in the season . He finished the night with eight points , three boards , three assists , three steals , and two threes in 27 minutes . Al Horford continued his hot start to the season by stuffing the stat sheet with 21 points , eight rebounds , four assists , two blocks , and one triple in 30 minutes of action . He was also an impressive 8 - for - 10 from the field . Dennis Schroder and Jeff Teague each chipped in with 20 and 16 points , respectively . Atlanta will look to continue their win streak Friday in New Orleans . Brooklyn 's lone bright spot Wednesday evening was Brook Lopez . The big man put up 27 points , 11 rebounds , three assists , and one block in 36 minutes . The Nets will aim to capture their first win Friday against the Lakers , who are also searching for their first victory .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

It was rough for the Bucks in the first half , as they found themselves down by as much as six to the NBA 's worst team . But they were able to kick it up a notch in the third quarter and outscore the Knicks by 13 in the period , and they were able to take care of business from there . Giannis Antetokounmpo was thrust back into the starting lineup after a DNP ( coach 's decision ) in Milwaukee 's last game , and he played very well , scoring 23 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 9 - 11 FT ) and grabbing nine rebounds in 31 minutes . Khris Middleton was not far behind , posting 22 points ( 9 - 16 FG , 3 - 6 3Pt ) , seven rebounds and he was very active defensively with six steals in 35 minutes . Michael Carter-Williams also continued his strong play as of late , scoring 19 points ( 8 - 13 FG ) , seven assists and four steals in 31 minutes . In his last two games , Carter-Williams has now combined for 49 points and 15 assists . As a team , the Bucks recorded an astounding 17 steals , and the victory keeps them in sixth place in the Eastern Conference . For now , they sit there comfortably with a two - game lead for that position with just three games remaining in the regular season . The dreadful season for the Knicks continues , as this loss is their 11th in their last 12 games . Langston Galloway was once again solid in the losing effort , scoring 20 points on 8 - of - 16 shooting in 35 minutes .

Charlotte drew a matchup with the East 's top team at the right time , with Atlanta resting four starters and Jeff Teague sitting out with a sprained ankle .

The Hawks cut the lead to single - digits in the fourth , but the Hornets , led by Mo Williams ' shooting , put them away . Williams finished with 18 points off the bench and made four of his five attempts from beyond the arc . The Hornets lead the season series 2 - 1 and they will meet one last time during the regular season on April 10 .

The game was a tale of two halves , as these teams showed why they have struggled so much this season . The Nuggets scored 64 points in the first half to take a 13 - point lead , but blew it in the second half with some bad defense . The Lakers outscored Denver 32 - 16 in the third quarter and went to Kobe Bryant to close things out at the end . Denver made some crucial errors late and it really hurt them in a game they really should have won . It was a vintage Kobe performance , as he carried the Lakers to a much needed win . He matched his season - high with 31 points and hit multiple baskets late to seal the victory . Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams both played good as well , as they scored 36 points combined . The offense has been terrible all season , for the Lakers , but this 111 - spot will hopefully get them going . Their next game will be on Christmas , when they take on the Los Angeles Clippers . The Nuggets had a season - high 21 - point lead in the second quarter , but managed to choke that away . They let the Lakers go on a 23 - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that . Will Barton scored 18 points in the first quarter , but really struggled after that , finishing with 25 in the game . The one bright spot was the bench , as all four players who came off the bench scored at least nine points while accumulating 58 points all together . Denver also played this game without Danilo Gallinari and that might have been the key in the loss with no go - to weapon at the end of the game . This was a brutal loss for Nuggets fans and they 'll look to bounce - back on Wednesday when they take on the Phoenix Suns .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

LeBron James ' homecoming did n't end the way he 'd probably imagined , and it appears James is trying to fit into the Cavaliers ' new offense as merely one of the cogs . He played 43 minutes but finished with just 17 points , which is more than 10 points off his career per - game average of 28 points . Kevin Love met his skeptics face - to - face , putting up a Love-like line of 19 points and 14 rebounds in 38 minutes . The Cavaliers used a nine - man rotation and leaned heavily on the starters in their first regular season game under new coach David Blatt . James , Love , Kyrie Irving , and Dion Waiters all played at least 38 minutes , while the minutes at center were split between starter Anderson Varejao ( 27 ) and backup center Tristan Thompson ( 20 ) . After looking like a lottery - bound team following their drubbing by the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday , the Knicks surprised everyone by pulling out a win over Cavaliers on Thursday . Carmelo Anthony played 34 minutes and finished with 25 points and six assists . Quincy Acy moved into the starting lineup at power forward , pushing Amar'e Stoudemire to a bench role . Acy played 22 minutes and finished with eight points and 10 rebounds . The Knicks leaned heavliy on their bench , with 10 players seeing at least 13 minutes of action Thursday . Starting center Samuel Dalembert played just six minutes and was replaced in the starting lineup in the second half by Jason Smith . The Cavaliers ' next game is on the road Friday against the Chicago Bulls . The Knicks ' next game is at home Sunday against the Charlotte Hornets .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

Kyle O'Quinn led the bench , providing 16 points , six rebounds , three assists and four blocks .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",
    "| 16  | December | 2015 | Wednesday | 2015   | Madison Square Garden     | New York City | New York       | 19800      | 19800    | 1735    | The Knicks ( 12 - 14 ) defeated the Timberwolves ( 9 - 16 ) by a score of 107 - 102 at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday . Minnesota was able to cut New York 's lead to three with 11 seconds remaining , but too many fouls earlier on in the fourth quarter put the game out of reach . The Knicks last 13 points all came from the charity stripe as Carmelo Anthony had perhaps his most well - rounded game of the season , scoring 20 points ( 6 - 15 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 7 - 8 FT ) with 15 rebounds , nine assists and four turnovers . Melo was a perfect 6 - for - 6 on crucial free throws late in the game . Timberwolves point guard Ricky Rubio came a point and two steals away from making history . He finished the game with nine points on 3 - of - 10 shooting from the field , 12 assists , 10 rebounds and eight steals , but was unable to complete the illusive quadruple - double . Karl-Anthony Towns got the best of his rookie counterpart Kristaps Porzingus , scoring a team - high 25 points ( 11 - 21 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) while pulling down 10 rebounds for his 11th double - double of the season . Andrew Wiggins also chipped in 23 points . Overshadowed by Anthony 's big performance was Aaron Afflalo 's game - high 29 points ( 9 - 14 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt , 8 - 9 FT ) . Afflalo did most of his work in the low post surprisingly and he had no trouble making easy work of a soft T-Wolves defense . It was playing with the second unit off the bench that really sparked Afflalo towards his big night . The Knicks still need to stay more consistent on the offensive end and barely escaped with a victory after blowing a 20 - point lead at halftime .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

The Jazz continued their strong play of late , recording their second straight win and seventh of their last ten . Despite the loss , the Nets actually were the superior shooters in this one , going 50 percent from the field and 53 percent from the three - point line , while the Jazz finished at 47 percent from the floor and 46 percent from deep . What may have been the deciding factor were free throws though . The Jazz converted on 17 - of - 21 , while the Nets shot just 11 and converted on only four of those 11 attempts . As has been the case for the Jazz all season , both Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors did the bulk of the work offensively . Hayward finished with a team - high of 24 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 8 - 9 FT ) , while adding five rebounds and three steals as well . It was his second impressive performance in a row , as he 's combined for 49 points , 14 rebounds , five assists and four steals over his last two . He 's now averaging 20 points and 5 rebounds on the year . Favors , on the other hand , posted 22 points ( 8 - 16 FG , 6 - 8 FT ) , eight rebounds and four assists in 37 minutes . He 's also played very well of late , averaging 19 points and 7 rebounds over his last four games . Rookie Dante Exum had one of the better games of his career , notching double figures in points for just the seventh time this season and first since the end of January . He went 5 - for - 6 from the field and a perfect 4 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 14 points , while adding four assists as well . The only other Jazz player to reach double - digit points was Trey Burke , who came off the bench for 12 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt ) and four assists in 20 minutes . The Nets really struggled to score in this one , with just three players reaching double figures in points . One of those players was Brook Lopez , who took over the starting center spot for Mason Plumlee , as Plumlee was put back into a bench role . In 35 minutes , Lopez scored 19 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 3 - 5 FT ) , to go along with 10 rebounds and two blocked shots . It was his second double - double in a row , as he 's combined for 38 points and 23 rebounds over that span . He 's now averaging 16 points and 7 rebounds on the season . Along with Lopez , Thaddeus Young also moved into the starting lineup Sunday , pushing Alan Anderson to the bench . He matched a team - high with 19 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt ) , while also adding three rebounds and four steals in 32 minutes . With such a strong performance , he should continue to start for the forseeable future . Coming off the bench , Bojan Bogdanovic added 11 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 3 - 4 3Pt ) in 21 minutes . Both Joe Johnson and Deron Williams struggled in this one , scoring nine and six points respectively . The Jazz 's next game will be at home against the New York Knicks on Tuesday , while the Nets will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

The Pistons took a 10 - point lead in the third quarter and looked poised to run away with it , but the Nets bench led by Andrea Bargnani put the Nets back on top early in the fourth quarter . It remained tight throughout the fourth quarter , as neither team managed more than a five - point lead at any point in the period , but Detroit 's one - two punch of Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson proved to be too tough for the Nets . Drummond finished with his third double - double in his past four games as he scored a team - high 21 points and grabbed a game - high 18 rebounds , including seven on the offensive end . Jacksom scored 19 and dished out six assists , and Ersan Ilyasova and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 16 apiece . The Pistons shot poorly ( 43 percent ) but used a ridiculous 19 offensive rebounds to keep their offense from going stagnant . Brook Lopez was ultra - efficient , as he scored a game - high 27 points on 13 - 19 shooting and grabbed five rebounds . Bargnani scored 18 off the bench on 7 - 12 shooting , but Wayne Ellington ( 4 - 11 FG , 3 - 5 3PT ) was the only other Nets player to reach double - digits with 11 . The Nets shot 49 percent from the floor , well above the Pistons ' mark , but thanks to their work on the glass , Detroit took 16 more field goals ( 98 ) than Brooklyn ( 82 ) , and that proved to be the difference in the game . The Pistons will continue their east coast road trip Wednesday in Boston . The Nets will continue their homestand with a Wednesday game against the Pacers .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

Both teams came into the game heading in opposite directions , making the final result all the more improbable . The Celtics had won nine of their last 10 games , and were riding a four - game winning streak that included a last - second victory over the Cavaliers . Meanwhile , Milwaukee came in as losers of five straight , and opted to shake up their starting five in advance of their tilt with Boston . Michael Carter-Williams and Greg Monroe headed to the second unit for the night , replaced at point guard and center by O.J . Mayo and Miles Plumlee , respectively . The first quarter went as expected , with visitors emerging with a 30 - 26 lead . However , the Bucks hung tough in the second period , and came out of intermission a different team . They doubled up the Celtics 40 - 20 in the third quarter , allowing them to take a seemingly safe 93 - 74 lead into the final 12 minutes . Boston had different ideas , turning the tables on Milwaukee in the fourth period , and managing to finally knot the game up at 111 with one second left after a pair of Kelly Olynyk free throws . Against all odds , Milwaukee found themselves with a chance to avoid overtime just four - tenths of a second later , in the form of Khris Middleton standing at the foul line . In an ironic twist , Avery Bradley , Boston 's hero in the aformentioned win over Cleveland , fouled Middleton as he tried to defend his last - second desperation shot , and the Bucks ' shooting guard sank the first free throw to seal the one - point win . The Celtics were led by a pair of 18 - point efforts from Bradley and Jae Crowder , who continues to play through a high ankle sprain . The former added four rebounds , four assists and a pair of steals , while the latter provided five rebounds , two assists and two steals . Isaiah Thomas registered 15 points , and supplemented it with a pair of assists and a pair of steals . Jared Sullinger only pitched in four points , but did add 11 rebounds and five assists . The bench was also highly productive on the night , with three players tallying double - digit scoring . Olynyk led the reserves with 15 points , three rebounds and a steal , while Jonas Jerebko managed 13 points and five boards . Marcus Smart collected 12 points of his own , and complemented it with four rebounds , two assists and two steals . Boston remains in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head back home to face off with the Clippers on Wednesday . Middleton was both the hero and the Bucks ' leading scorer among the starting five , posting 20 points , five rebounds and five assists . Giannis Antetokounmpo was next with 14 points , three rebounds , two assists , two steals and a trio of blocks . Jabari Parker bounced back from two sub - par outings with 10 points , three boards , two assists and a steal . Monroe responded to his demotion with a breakout 29 - point , 12 - rebound double - double off the bench that also included three assists , a steal and a pair of rejections . Carter-Williams also appeared motivated by his ouster from the first unit , contributing 16 points , six rebounds , five assists and a steal over 26 minutes . Jerryd Bayless was the third reserve with double - digit scoring , totaling 14 points , a rebound and two assists . Milwaukee remains in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division despite the win . They 're home again Thursday for a showdown with the Washington Wizards . |\n",

The Thunder picked up a much - needed win on the back of Russell Westbrook as they fight to keep their playoff hopes in the Western Conference alive . Westbrook scored and shot the ball well Friday night , posting a game - high 27 points ( 11 - 19 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt ) , 10 assists and five rebounds in 38 minutes . Enes Kanter also continued his strong offensive play , scoring 25 points ( 9 - 14 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 6 - 8 FT ) and grabbing six rebounds in 32 minutes . Kanter is now averaging 22 points 12 rebounds in the month of April . Dion Waiters played one of his best games of the season , scoring 22 points ( 9 - 19 FG ) in 40 minutes , while Anthony Morrow scored 19 points ( 7 - 17 FG , 5 - 10 3Pt ) and grabbed six rebounds in 26 minutes off the bench . The win keeps Oklahoma City in the playoff hunt , but they are currently on the outside looking in . Despite holding the same record as the Pelicans for the final spot in the West , New Orleans holds the tiebreaker , so the Thunder will have to hope the Pelicans lose one of their final three games to even have a chance . The Kings are well out of the playoff race and ca n't stay healthy as they close out the regular season . Both DeMarcus Cousins ( foot ) and Rudy Gay ( head ) sat out for the second consecutive game , leaving Sacramento without their two best offensive players . Ben McLemore led the way for the Kings in the losing effort , scoring 20 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 4 - 10 3Pt ) in 35 minutes . His running - mate in the backcourt , Ray McCallum , posted a solid stat line of 17 points ( 8 - 11 FG ) , six rebounds and four assists in 38 minutes . Filling in for Gay , Omri Casspi scored a solid 15 points ( 4 - 9 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 5 - 8 FT ) and grabbed six rebounds in 28 minutes , while Jason Thompson , filling in for Cousins , scored just five points but managed to grab 14 rebounds in 26 minutes . Derrick Williams ( 17 ) was the only other Kings player to score in double figures Friday . Up next , the Thunder will travel to Indiana Sunday to play the Pacers , while the Kings will head to Denver and take on the Nuggets on Sunday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

Both teams have already clinched a playoff berth in their respective conferences , but it was the Cavaliers who were able to continue with their momentum , winning their fourth straight game Wednesday . They continue to sit as the second seed in the East , eight games back from the Atlanta Hawks . The Grizzlies , on the other hand , remain second in the West , and sit eight and a half games back from the Golden State Warriors . The Cavaliers were the superior shooters in this game , going 51 percent from the field and 41 percent from the three - point line , while the Grizzlies finished at 44 percent from the floor and just 24 percent from deep . While they only received 18 combined points from their bench , the Cavaliers ' starters all had big games , with each finishing in double figure points . Kyrie Irving led the way with 24 points ( 9 - 21 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) , while also contributing two assists and two steals . It was his second solid performance in a row , as he 's now combined for 44 points , nine assists and four steals over his last two games . Kevin Love looked as if he could n't miss a shot , going 10 - for - 13 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 22 points , to go along with 10 rebounds and two blocked shots . Despite averaging 17 points on the season , he had n't surpassed the 11 - point mark in four games , so it was good to see him finally break out and have a solid game . LeBron James also had a strong showing , finishing with 20 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , eight rebounds and five assists . Over his last three games , he 's now averaging 26 points , 8 rebounds , 5 assists and 2 steals .

He 's riding a nice two - game stretch , combining for 39 points and 11 rebounds .

He went 7 - for - 10 from the field to score 15 points , while playing just 21 minutes . It was his highest point total since the end of January , as it marked one of the few bright spots in this game for the Grizzlies . Also coming off the bench , Jeff Green chipped in with 11 points ( 4 - 11 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and five rebounds . The Cavaliers ' next game will be on the road against the Brooklyn Nets on Friday , while the Grizzlies will be at home against the Golden State Warriors on Friday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

Portland clinched the Northwest Division shortly before tip - off after Oklahoma City fell to Memphis , but that did n't stop the Trail Blazers from putting the exclamation point on the night . The Trail Blazers started hot and finished hot , outscoring the Lakers 26 - 12 in the first quarter and 33 - 14 in the fourth . Second-year guard C.J McCollum poured in a team - high 27 points in 27 minutes off the bench . With Friday 's win , the Trail Blazers completed the season sweep over the Lakers . Portland had n't won a division title outright since the 1998 - 99 season when it was a member of the Pacific Division . Damian Lillard posted 20 points on an efficient 8 - of - 15 shooting performance that included going 4 - of - 8 from beyond the arc . The Trail Blazers currently hold the fourth spot in the Western Conference , but have one less win than the Clippers and Spurs . The division title looms large in this case as the Warriors have already clinched the Clippers ' division and the Spurs have an uphill climb to unseat the Grizzlies and Rockets in the Southwest . The Trail Blazers will play the second half of a back - to - back set Saturday when they host the Pelicans . Los Angeles ' season - long woes continued Friday with another blowout loss in front of the home crowd . Friday 's defeat tied a not - so - prestigious franchise record for most losses in a single season . The Lakers are almost assured to have one of the bottom - five records in the league this season , which should allow them to have a top - five pick in the upcoming draft .

The bruised , weary , and depleted Heat are running out of able bodies , and it showed in their play on Wednesday . Fresh off a six - game road swing through the Western Conference and a subsequent 91 - 79 loss to the Bucks at American Airlines Arena in South Florida on Tuesday , Miami hit the road again shortly after the conclusion of that contest . Already down their top two point guards , the Heat then found out shortly before the game that Dwyane Wade would give his ailing shoulders a rest against the Wizards , leaving Gerald Green , who 'd been battling some knee tendinitis himself , in a starting role . Then , midway through the second quarter , injury befell one of the few healthy starters left , as Hassan Whiteside went out with a strained oblique and was unable to return . All of the personnel changes led to some predictably sluggish and sloppy play , with Miami turning the ball over 21 times , leading to 27 points for the home team . The visitors were spearheaded by the most talented healthy body remaining , Chris Bosh . The forward managed 18 points , four rebounds , two assists and a steal . Luol Deng , the other front - line player not watching from the bench , was next in line with 16 points , eight rebounds , an assist and a block . Tyler Johnson , filling in once again for both Goran Dragic ( calf ) and Beno Udrih ( neck ) , bounced back from an abysmal outing versus the Bucks by totaling 14 points , five assists and two rebounds . Veteran Amar'e Stoudemire paced the Heat bench with a season - high 11 points . The Heat fell to 23 - 20 - - their sixth loss in the last seven games - - and remain in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They now head to Toronto for a matchup with the Raptors on Friday . Washington was led by a pair of 18 - point efforts from a familiar duo , John Wall and Bradley Beal . Wall did his damage as a starter over 32 minutes , and added 10 assists and four rebounds . Beal , in turn , turned in his effort in a reserve role over 25 minutes . He supplemented his scoring with three rebounds , two assists and a steal . Nene Hilario was next in line with an outstanding all - around performance , posting 16 points , six rebounds , an assist and five steals . Marcin Gortat took advantage of an extended stretch without Whiteside in front of him , putting together his fifth straight double - double with 15 points , 12 rebounds , two assists and a pair of blocks . Garrett Temple was productive as well , amassing 11 points , three assists , two rebounds and a steal . The Wizards improved to 20 - 21 and are now in a third - place tie with the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They remain home and await the Utah Jazz for a Saturday evening showdown .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

If the Celtics could get balanced efforts like these across their roster on a consistent basis , they would likely sport an even better record . Virtually every Boston player seemed to be hitting on all cylinders Friday , with seven managing double - digit scoring . They also received a double - double and a triple - double from Jared Sullinger and Marcus Smart , respectively , and outperformed the visitors in every major offensive and defensive category . The Celtics cruised to a 68 - 47 halftime lead , before finishing things out in the second half for their largest margin of victory since Dec. 22 against the Timberwolves . The Suns ' leading scorer came from the bench , as Mirza Teletovic continued his solid stretch of offensive play . The power forward posted 22 points , two rebounds and an assist over 21 minutes , his seventh consecutive double - digit scoring performance . Brandon Knight was tops among the starters , collecting 16 points , four assists , two steals and a block . T.J. Warren and Sonny Weems were two more solid contributors off the bench , amassing 13 and 10 points , respectively . The latter was particularly proficient across the stat sheet , adding six rebounds , five assists and a pair of steals . Markieff Morris , back in the starting lineup , tallied nine points , nine rebounds , four assists and a steal . The Suns fell to 13 - 28 and remain in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They now head to Minnesota to face off with the Timberwolves on Sunday .

The Mavericks and Nuggets were in a tightly - contested battle at halftime , but something drastic happened to alter the result . The Nuggets did n't show up in the third quarter and they put up some mind boggling stats . Denver started the quarter going 0 - for - 14 with six turnovers and failed to score in the first nine minutes . That started a 160 run for Dallas and they never looked back after that . The turnovers were a problem as well , as Dallas won that battle 20 - 13 . A five - point third quarter proved to be the difference in a frustrating loss for the Nuggets . Scoring 29 points in the second half simply wo n't get it done in the NBA and that 's just what the Nuggets did . The team was led by Darrell Arthur , who tallied 16 points , five rebounds , two steals and two blocks in the defeat . Kenneth Faried did make his return after a three - game absence due to an ankle injury , but played just 14 minutes . Denver has now scored 161 points over their last two games and this is obviously not the potent up - tempo Denver offense of the past . They 'll look to get out of this six - game skid when they play another struggling team in the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday . Dallas played some fantastic defense en route to an impressive win on Saturday . The surprise start for Dallas has to be credited to Zaza Pachulia , who put in yet another great game . Pachulia collected 16 points , 12 rebounds and three steals to pick up his 10th double - double of the season . Deron Williams also had a nice game , as he amassed 22 points , four assists and four rebounds in the win . The Mavericks had 13 steals in the game and they forced the Nuggets into bad shots time after time . This is n't the prettiest team in the NBA , but they 're certainly dangerous and a threat in the West . Dallas will play the Sacramento Kings on Monday in their next scheduled game .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

With 45 points and 17 rebounds against the Pelicans , Davis is the first player since Michael Jordan in 1991 to score 90 or more points in the first two games of the season . Davis is also the first player 23 or younger to ever have multiple 45 - point , 15 - rebound outings in the same season , a feat he has managed to accomplish in just two games . Despite Davis 's absurd individual achievements , the Pelicans remain winless . For the Warriors , meanwhile , the big four of Steph Curry , Klay Thompson , Kevin Durant , and Draymond Green contributed big numbers in Friday 's win . Durant led the team with 30 points and 17 rebounds , while Curry and Green dished out seven assists each . Curry also hit four three - pointers , including the 1,600th of his career . Curry is just the 19th player in NBA history to reach the mark , and the fastest to do so , having played just 497 career games .The Golden State Warriors defeated the host New Orleans Pelicans on Friday , 122 - 114 . The Warriors ( 1 - 1 ) bounced back from a nationally - televised 29 - point loss to the San Antonio Spurs on opening night . High-profile free agency acquisition Kevin Durant was the difference maker for Golden State on Friday , leading the team with 30 points and 17 rebounds . The Warriors depth also showed , as the team was able to pull away with the lead during Anthony Davis 's rest at the end of the third quarter . All-Stars Steph Curry and Klay Thompson made major contributions in the points column as well , scoring 23 and 28 respectively . The team displayed impressive ball movement , recording 32 assists on the night . While the Warriors saw major top - down contributions , the Pelicans ( 0 - 2 ) were able to stay in contention on the back of Anthony Davis . After opening the season with a 50 - point , 16 - rebound , near - five - by - five , Davis continued to dominate with a game - high 45 points and 17 rebounds . 'The Brow ' was able to convert on a whopping 17 of 31 field goal attempts , including one of two tries from beyond the arc . Davis did see help from guard Tim Frazier , who posted a 21 - point , 10 - assist double - double . Outside of Davis and Frazier , however , no Pelicans starter scored more than four points . Sixth overall pick Buddy Hield particularly struggled , scoring just two points on 16 percent shooting with two turnovers in 19 minutes . The Pelicans will see the Spurs in San Antonio on Saturday , while the Warriors will visit Phoenix on Sunday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

The Heat did most of their damage in the first half , out - scoring the Celitcs 52 - 42 . They were able to finish the game shooting 47 percent from the field and 29 percent from the three - point line , while the Celtics shot 40 percent from the floor and 26 percent from beyond the arc . The Heat were able to force the Celitcs into 15 turnovers , giving them an even greater advantage to take home the victory . The Heat had six players reach double figures in points in this one . Luol Deng led all scorers with 23 points , after shooting 9 - for - 15 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line . He also went a perfect 4 - of - 4 from the free throw line .

Although it was n't his best day shooting from the floor , he still made up for it with the opportunities he gave to his teammates . Norris Cole also benefitted from some extra playing time and scored 15 points in 37 minutes . The fifteen points were the most he 's had since scoring 23 points in the season opener and the minutes played was near a season - high . James Ennis also provided a big boost off the bench with 16 points ( 4 - 8 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 6 - 6 FT ) and eight rebounds . It was a season - high in points for him as he has only reached double figures in points once before . The Celtics struggled to find any consistent offense in their young lineup . Tyler Zeller did most of the damage for them as he went 10 - for - 15 from the floor and 2 - for - 3 from the free throw line to score 22 points , while also grabbing eight rebounds . It was only the second time Zeller has broken the 20 - point mark this season .

Chicago entered Thursday 's game after a gutting loss to Cleveland on Monday that had people questioning the direction in which the Bulls season was going . The Bulls started to pull away in the third quarter thanks to a solid combined effort from Derrick Rose , Jimmy Butler , and Taj Gibson . The Spurs were held to just 37 % shooting from the floor . The Spurs were on a four - game winning streak coming into this game and had won six of its last seven . Kawhi Leonard turned in another solid performance , putting up 16 points and 4 rebounds , but the Spurs were out of this game by the fourth quarter and no starter played more than 27 minutes . The Spurs will wrap up a back - to - back set Friday against the Lakers . Chicago needed to make a statement Thursday against one of the NBA 's deepest and well - coached teams . The Bulls came out with aggressiveness on both ends of the floor and were able to out - rebound the Spurs despite missing Joakim Noah . Chicago plays seven of its next eight games on the road , starting Friday in Dallas .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

This was the Reggie Jackson homecoming game , but he did n't have his best performance . In fact , both point guards struggled mightily . Jackson battled foul trouble all game long while shooting just 4 - for - 16 from the field . Westbrook was even worse , as he tallied just 14 points , four rebounds and four assists while committing a ghastly 11 turnovers . These were the top - two rebounding teams in the NBA coming in and that proved to be the difference . The Thunder actually outrebounded the Pistons 58 - 38 and simply dominated the boards . The Pistons are usually carried by Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond , but they were both battling foul trouble all game long . That 's a recipe for disaster and they could n't quite bounce - back with that adversity . They still managed to combine for 30 points and 12 rebounds but that was n't enough . In fact , those seven rebounds from Drummond marks the first time he has n't cracked double - digits this season . The Pistons also did n't get much bench production , as only four players came off the bench with none of them scoring more than six points . If Drummond and Jackson are going to battle foul problems and the bench does n't step up , a win is a nearly impossible proposition . Detroit will take on the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday in their next scheduled game . The Thunder got a win , despite Westbrook 's worst game of the season . The defense was the key , as they held the Pistons to just 32 points in the second half . Oklahoma City was also happy to see Kevin Durant at full strength and playing at an MVP level in this game . Durant dropped 34 points , 13 rebounds , five assists and three blocks in the win . Those are the types of performances the Thunder need from Durant all season if they are to compete for an NBA title . That is the beauty of having Durant and Westbrook . If one is off , the other can go crazy and carry the team on any given night . Oklahoma City will have a tough matchup in their next game , as they travel to Atlanta to take on the Hawks on Monday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

After dishing six assists Saturday , Griffin is averaging nearly six per game since Dec. 1 , which is supplementing his usual stat - laden line . The Clippers have now cobbled together back - to - back wins , and victories in five of the past six games , which they 'll attempt to uphold in Sunday 's showdown against the Heat . On the other side , Dallas has dropped two contests in a row , after tallying a six - game winning streak , but their primary scoring threats did n't disappoint . Dirk Nowitzki , the NBA 's seventh - leading scorer all - time , supplied 25 points ( 10 - 19 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , six rebounds , and one assist in 30 minutes . Meanwhile , Monta Ellis drilled four treys of his own en route to 23 points , six assists , four rebounds , and one steal . The remaining Mavericks fired at a 37 percent clip ( 19 - for - 52 ) , though , which was n't enough against the Clippers ' hot hand .

The Pelicans picked up their first win of the season on Tuesday in brilliant fashion . The final score makes it look like a respectable loss , but the Pelicans were up by double - digits nearly the whole game . New Orleans shot 50 percent from the field and made 14 three - pointers en route to a win . Dallas made three big offseason signings and it has yet to work out for them . In this game specifically , Wesley Matthews , Chandler Parsons and Deron Williams combined for just 11 points , seven rebounds and five assists across 55 minutes of action . The team was led by its bench in this game , as they totaled 58 points in the defeat . The Mavericks got a nice performance from Charlie Villanueva off the bench as well , who amassed 15 points and nine rebounds across 26 minutes of play . The Mavericks were able to rest their starters quite a bit here and that could be beneficial when they will look to rebound in their next game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday in the second half of a back - to - back . The Pelicans got that first elusive win , and it came in relatively easy fashion . They had five players who scored at least 17 points with Ryan Anderson leading the bunch . Anderson put up 25 points and 11 rebounds while going 10 - for - 16 from the field . Ish Smith continued his good form as well , as he provided 17 points and 12 assists off the bench . Star Anthony Davis was forced out due to a hip issue and his status is unkown at this tome for the Pelican next game . This team is way too talented to get their first win on November 10 and hopefully this will be the start of a big run . They 'll look to start a winning - streak against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday in the second half of a back - to - back .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

It was a low - scoring affair for both sides , due in large part to cold perimeter shooting from both teams . For Dallas ( 1 - 5 ) , the vast majority of the team 's scoring came from guard J.J. Barea and forward Harrison Barnes , who scored a combined 55 points on the night . While Barnes hit half his shot attempts and Barea shot a respectable 8 - of - 18 from the floor with a pair of three - pointers , the Mavericks hit just 38 percent of their attempts from the floor . Shooting guard Wesley Matthews was particularly shaky from the field , hitting just 3 - of - 17 from the field on the night . The lead flipped back and forth throughout , with stagnant offense making it difficult for either team to establish a significant lead . Dallas finally appeared to get things going in overtime , however , as they were able to outscore Milwaukee 12 - 1 in the extra period . For Milwaukee ( 4 - 3 ) , shooting was an equally significant struggle , as the team hit just 37 percent of its shots from the floor with only six three - pointers made . Point-forward Giannis Antetokounmpo had his quietest night of the season going just 4 - of - 12 from the field for only 11 points . It was a promising night for third - year forward Jabari Parker , however . The former second overall pick had 16 points and seven rebounds while hitting half his shot attempts . The Mavericks will visit the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday , while Milwaukee will have a long break before facing the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday .Harrison Barnes has been enjoying a lot more offensive freedom with his new team . The former Warrior is averaging a career - high in both points and field goal attempts , both of which experienced boosts after Sunday 's win . Barnes saw the third 30 - point game of his career and the second of the season , scoring 34 points on a team - high 26 attempts from the field . Interestingly , Barnes has seen his efficiency increase , as he hit half his shots yet again on Sunday . Another young and statistically dominant forward , Milwaukee 's Giannis Antetokounmpo , had an off night on Sunday , going just 4 - of - 12 on the night . The 'Greek Freak ' had been leading the Bucks in every major statistical category heading into Sunday . His teammates were forced to pick up his slack , however , as he posted numbers well below his averages , including just two assists .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

After a lackluster showing against the Grizzlies on Sunday , the Lakers came ready to play , looking like a team that was capable of much more than the five wins they had amassed on the season . The two teams hit intermission all knotted up at 58 , Los Angeles ' best first - half point tally of the current campaign . However , Kemba Walker took control of the game in the second half for the Hornets , particularly in the final period . The 25 - year - old guard collected 18 of his 23 second - half points in the fourth quarter , helping Charlotte pull away from the Lakers by a 10 - point margin at game 's end . Walker shot an outstanding 56 percent ( 14 - for - 25 ) from the field , and drained half of his six three - point attempts for an eye - popping 38 points overall . Los Angeles was led once again by Kobe Bryant , who amassed 20 points , four rebounds and a pair of assists . Although he was the Lakers ' top scorer , some of the shooting struggles that he 'd left behind in recent games did resurface . The future Hall of Famer could only sink 25 percent of his 20 attempts from the field , making it his worst figure in that category since a 13 percent - outing versus Detroit on December 6 . Larry Nance , Jr. did follow up his first career double - double on Sunday with a 12 - point , seven - rebound encore , and Louis Williams pitched in with a nicely rounded line of 11 points , seven assists and four boards . The bench also provided outstanding production , as Brandon Bass ( 12 points , three rebounds , an assist and two steals ) was joined by Julius Randle ( 11 points , six rebounds ) and Nick Young ( 11 points , two assists and a rebound ) as double - digit scoring reserves . The Lakers fell to 5 - 27 and remain in last place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They head to Boston to face off against the Celtics on Wednesday . In addition to Walker 's memorable performance , the Hornets also benefitted from another productive effort from Cody Zeller , Even though Al Jefferson was active for his second game after missing 11 contests with a calf injury and suspension , Zeller still received 33 minutes and managed 16 points , eight rebounds and a pair of assists . Nicolas Batum posted a second straight double - double , collecting 15 points , dishing out 11 assists , and topping it off with five boards . P.J . Hairston added 13 points , and Jeremy Lin matched his scoring total from the bench , while adding six rebounds , four assists , a pair of blocks and a steal against his former teammates . Charlotte improved to 17 - 13 and currently resides in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They remain home to face the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

Although their postseason hopes have long been crushed , the Kings took on the third - seeded Thunder as if they had something to play for . Kings coach George Karl opted to give Rajon Rondo another night off to rest , bringing Darren Collison into the starting lineup . The veteran guard responded well to the starting opportunity , tallying the team 's highest point total . The high - scoring , back - and - forth affair came down to the final seconds , as Rudy Gay was able to sink two free throws after a Serge Ibaka foul with less than a second remaining . On the Thunder 's last - gasp possession , Russell Westbrook , who committed a game - high eight turnovers , missed a desperation 52 - foot three - point heave that would have sent the game into overtime . Oklahoma City was led by Kevin Durant 's 31 points , which he supplemented with eight assists and six rebounds . Westbrook was next with 24 points , 10 assists , five rebounds and a steal . Ibaka managed 14 points , eight rebounds and two steals . Enes Kanter paced the bench with 11 points , six rebounds and a steal .

    "| 14  | February | 2017 | Tuesday   | 2016   | Target Center             | Minneapolis    | Minnesota      | 17700      | 19000    | 3558    | The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 116 - 108 Tuesday at Target Center . The Timberwolves ( 21 - 35 ) managed to keep pace with the East-leading Cavaliers ( 38 - 16 ) for a majority of Tuesday 's contest , and they were well within striking distance down the final stretch of the game . That was until LeBron James hit a step back three - pointer with two minutes remaining to take his team 's lead from three points to six . At that point , Minnesota was finished . James finished with 25 points on an efficient 10 - of - 14 shooting from the field to go along with 14 assists and eight rebounds as the Cavaliers walked out of the Target Center with their second straight victory and their sixth win in their last seven games . Kyrie Irving added 25 points of his own , Channing Frye posted a double - double of 21 points and 10 rebounds as Kevin Love 's replacement and the newest Cavalier , Derrick Williams , came off the bench to score 13 points Tuesday . As for those Timberwolves , a brilliant performance from Andrew Wiggins ended up not being enough for a team that has lacked a strong supporting cast all season . After scoring 20 points in the third quarter , Wiggins finished the game with 41 points on 16 - of - 29 shooting from the field . Karl-Anthony Towns had yet another productive night as well , scoring 26 points and grabbing eight rebounds , but besides those two , Minnesota failed to get much else offensively from their team . Ricky Rubio did manage to dish out a game - high 16 assists and grab eight rebounds , but he was n't able to produce enough in the scoring column , ending with just five points on 2 - of - 8 shooting from the field . Up next , the Cavaliers will look to continue to build on their lead in the Eastern Conference on Wednesday against the Pacers , while the Timberwolves will travel to Denver on Wednesday to take on the Nuggets .This season , Ricky Rubio has proven to be a crucial member of Minnesota 's offense with no legitimate backup point guards and now without the services of Zach LaVine ( knee ) . However , while Rubio has been putting up big - time assist numbers as of late , he remains a liability scoring - wise . Tuesday 's performance was yet another example for the Spaniard , as he posted a game - high 16 assists , which was his highest total since he dished out 17 on Jan. 11 against the Rockets . And while Rubio did an adequate job of getting his teammates involved , he struggled to get himself involved , scoring just five points on 2 - of - 8 shooting from the field . This was n't an aberration for the point guard either , as it was the seventh time this season that Rubio was able to record double - digit assists but not reach double - digit points .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

It was a big night for two Blazers in particular , as center Jusuf Nurkic and guard C.J . McCollum combined for 72 points for Portland ( 36 - 38 ) . Nurkic contributed a career - high scoring output of 33 points to go along with a whopping 16 rebounds and three blocks . The output came against his former team , from whom he was traded at the deadline . Nurkic was absolutely deadly from the field , shooting 12 - of - 15 from the field and 9 - of - 11 at the free - throw line . McCollum , meanwhile , shot 15 - of - 24 for a game - high 39 points . The two were the centers of a red - hot Blazers offense , as the team shot over 49 percent from the field and reached the line 33 times on the night . Denver ( 35 - 39 ) , meanwhile , saw slightly more balanced production from their scorers . Six Nuggets scored in double figures , and their own young big man nearly recorded a triple - double . Sophomore center Nikola Jokic cleaned up , recording 17 points , eight rebounds , and eight assists . However , the team simply could not slow down the two hot scorers for Portland . Foul trouble proved problematic as well , as the Nuggets got to the line 20 times but gave up 33 free - throws to Portland . The game was hugely impactful on the playoff standings , as Portland was able to pass Denver for eighth in the conference thanks to the win . Portland will host Houston on Wednesday , while Denver will visit Charlotte on Thursday .It was a huge night for Portland 's young stars , and in particular , recently acquired big man Jusuf Nurkic . Nurkic had a career - high 33 points on 12 - of - 15 shooting and 9 - of - 11 at the free - throw line against his former team . Offense was n't the only thing Nurkic provided , though , as he pulled down a whopping 16 rebounds to go along with two steals and three blocks . The young center continues to grow in his new starting role with Portland . Nurkic was not even his team 's high scorer , however , as shooting guard C.J . McCollum exploded for 39 points . McCollum shot 15 - of - 24 from the field and splashed home three three - pointers on the night . In addition , McCollum had five rebounds , three assists , and went 6 - of - 6 at the free - throw line . For Denver , young big man Nikola Jokic made an impact with 17 points , eight rebounds , and eight assists . Veteran starter Jameer Nelson also contributed somewhat surprisingly with a team - high 23 points on the night .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

Despite both teams having already been eliminated from playoff contention , this still marked a hard fought game between these Western Conference rivals . The Kings came out as the superior shooters in this one , going 53 percent from the field and 38 percent from the three - point line , while the Timberwolves finished at 48 percent from the floor and just 32 percent from deep . Also helping push the Kings to a win was their rebounding , as they finished with a 49 - 36 advantage . With DeMarcus Cousins sidelined because of a foot injury , it was Rudy Gay and Omri Casspi who really stepped up and had huge games . Gay finished with 33 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 13 - 15 FT ) , seven rebounds and five assists , while Casspi posted 31 points ( 12 - 20 FG , 4 - 6 3Pt , 3 - 5 FT ) and five rebounds . Casspi had far - and - away his best performance of the season , as he 's really picked it up lately . Over his last four games , he 's averaging 20 points , while shooting an impressive 57 percent from the field . Gay , on the other hand , is on fire as well , combining to go 19 - of - 35 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from deep for 57 points over his last two outings . He 's now pushed his season averages to 21 points and 6 rebounds per game on the season . Coming off the bench , Derrick Williams had a strong showing as well . He went 8 - for - 12 from the field to score 18 points , while adding eight rebounds over 31 minutes as well . The 18 points matched a season - high for the forward , as it was one of his better outings of the year . Despite being unable to limit the Kings ' offense , the Timberwolves nearly pulled off the victory due to some strong offensive performances of their own . Kevin Martin had the most impressive line , finishing with 37 points ( 13 - 31 FG , 3 - 11 3Pt , 8 - 11 FT ) and eight assists . It was a season - high in field goal attempts for the guard , who had a slightly better performance than he did on Friday , where he went just 3 - of - 12 from the field . He 's now averaging 20 points on the season and will continue to get off a ton of shots due to the vast amount of injuries the Timberwolves are dealing with . Rookie Andrew Wiggins had a big game as well though , recording 26 points ( 11 - 20 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) and eight rebounds . He 's posted 20 points or more in seven of his last eight games , as he 's done his best to help Martin pick up the slack of those sitting out . Zach LaVine was the other big contributor . In 40 minutes , he finished with 21 points ( 9 - 18 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) and 11 assists , marking just the second double - double of his career . The Kings ' next game will be on the road against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday , while the Timberwolves will travel to Portland to take on the Trail Blazers on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

Houston got out to a fast start , taking a commanding 44 - 18 lead by the 11 - minute mark in the second quarter . The Thunder cut the Rockets ' lead to 10 early in the fourth , but Houston answered with a 120 run to effectively close out Oklahoma City . Houston ended the game shooting 47 % from the floor , but was shooting above 50 % for much of the contest . Oklahoma City came out flat after a long rest , having last played on Friday against Utah . Things wo n't get much easier for the Thunder , who host the Warriors on Friday before going on a five - game road trip next week against the likes of the Wizards and Hawks . Oklahoma City is now three and a half games behind Phoenix for the eighth seed in the West . Houston has now won both games against Oklahoma City this season , although Thursday 's contest was drastically different than the 69 - 65 game in November where both teams shot under 30 % from the floor . Point guard Patrick Beverley , who suffered a knee contusion Wednesday , was able to play 32 minutes and finished with 13 points and five rebounds . James Harden finished one rebound shy of a triple - double as he dropped 31 points , 10 assists , and nine rebounds on the Thunder .

Both teams came into the game with notable changes to their respective starting lineups . Atlanta ( 24 - 17 ) gave Dwight Howard the afternoon off for rest , which slid Paul Millsap over to center and Thabo Sefolosha to power forward , as Mike Muscala was unavailable due to an ankle injury suffered Sunday . Meanwhile , the Knicks ( 18 - 24 ) replaced Courtney Lee with Ron Baker at the two - guard spot , and brought Mindaugas Kuzminskas into the starting five as well with Lance Thomas unavailable due to a broken orbital bone and possible concussion brought about by a Jonas Valanciunas elbow a day prior . Carmelo Anthony shifted to power forward in place of Kristaps Porzingis , who was once again absent due to his sore Achilles . The personnel shifts did n't affect the quality of play in the least , and in fact , may have enhanced it . The two teams engaged in an entertaining back - and - forth battle that was n't decided until the final seconds , when a Joakim Noah shot attempt failed to find the net . Dennis Schroder , who had endured a rough couple of games coming in to Monday , had given the Hawks what would be their final margin of victory with a 25 - foot three - pointer jumper with 22 seconds remaining . A revitalized Schroder led Atlanta with 28 points overall , a total he supplemented with three rebounds and three assists . Tim Hardaway , Jr. checked in second with 20 points , four assists , three rebounds and a steal . Millsap was effective at the five , posting 17 points , seven rebounds , six assists , three steals and three blocks . Kent Bazemore followed up a strong Sunday showing with 16 points , six rebounds , five assists and a steal . Kris Humphries got extra run off the bench with Muscala out and led the second unit with 14 points , seven boards , an assist and a steal . The Knicks were paced by Carmelo Anthony , who went off for 30 points , seven rebounds , two assists and a steal . Derrick Rose followed with a near double - double consisting of 18 points , nine assists , four rebounds , a steal and a block . Kuzminskas supplied 14 points , five rebounds , two assists and a pair of steals . Noah registered a modest seven points but hauled in 17 boards , while also providing three assists , two blocks and a steal . Justin Holiday led the bench with 11 points and four rebounds . The Hawks continue on the road and next head to the Motor City , where they 'll face the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night . The Knicks make the short trip to Boston to tangle with the Celtics that same evening .Dennis Schroder 's 28 points led the Hawks , and his three - pointer with 22 seconds remaining ended up being the game - winning basket .

Midway through the third quarter , it looked like the Warriors were going to run away with the game , maintaining a double - digit lead through the first six or so minutes . However , the Clippers were able to make a run late in the quarter to take a one - point lead into final period . From there , it was the Stephen Curry show . While Los Angeles managed to keep it close through the final 12 minutes , they simply had no answer for last year 's MVP . Curry scored 13 points in the fourth quarter and finished with 31 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 7 - 11 3Pt ) for the game in 33 minutes . Harrison Barnes also came up big in the fourth quarter , scoring 10 straight points at one point and finishing with a team - high nine rebounds in 36 minutes . Klay Thompson 's clutch free throws put the game out of reach , and his block on Jamal Crawford in the closing seconds sealed the deal . He finished with 16 points in 32 minutes . For the Clippers , Chris Paul and Blake Griffin did everything they could to keep their team in the game , but in the end , it just was n't enough . Griffin stuffed the stat sheet , scoring 23 points , grabbing 10 rebounds and dishing out six assists in 38 minutes , while Paul managed a team - high 24 points and nine assists in 29 minutes . DeAndre Jordan recorded a double - double of 11 points and 13 rebounds . Up next , the Warriors will stay at home to play the Nuggets on Thursday , while the Clippers will head home Friday to face the Rockets .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

    "| 21  | November | 2015 | Saturday  | 2015   | American Airlines Arena   | Miami          | Florida        | 19700      | 19600    | 1567    | The Miami Heat ( 8 - 4 ) held off the Philadelphia 76ers ( 0 - 14 ) to win 96 - 91 on Saturday . This was the Sixers best chance at a win all season , but they could n't quite hold off the Heat . Miami ended the game on a 20 - 4 run and held the Sixers to one basket over the final seven - plus minutes . Not to mention , that one basket was a meaningless one with just seconds left in the game . The Heat held the Sixers to 38 percent shooting and blocked 14 shots in the win . Philadelphia 's bench was a bright spot though , as they outscored Miami 's bench 47 to 26 . This was a rough loss in a disastrous season for Philadelphia . They had a big lead early , but simply could n't hold on . They did get two great bench performances , as Robert Covington dropped 21 points while Isiah Caanan dropped 22 points . Philadelphia 's best player on this night was rookie Jahlil Okafor , who tallied 16 points , 11 rebounds and three steals en route to a double - double . The rookie now leads the team in scoring and is second on the team in rebounding . They might have their best chance at a win when they take on the equally - young Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday . The Heat looked horrible in the first half , but leaned on their stifling defense to pull out a big win . Miami got an outstanding performance from Dwyane Wade , who tallied 27 points , seven rebounds , four assists and three steals in the victory . Hassan Whiteside also had a great game , as he collected 13 points , nine rebounds and eight blocks in the win . Those eight blocks add to his already league - leading total and he 's truly playing at a different level this season than years past . This is one of the best defenses in the NBA right now and they showed why on Saturday . Miami will look to keep up their strong defense against the surging New York Knicks on Monday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

After being out - scored by 20 points in the second quarter , the Sixers had themselves in a hole , as they were down 64 - 51 at the half . They came out with a big third quarter though , where they out - scored the Kings 37 - 18 to give them just enough of a lead to secure the seven - point win in front of their home crowd . While both teams are likely going to miss the playoffs , it was still a nice win for the Sixers , who notch just their fifteenth victory of the season . The Sixers did n't have the best night shooting the ball , but they still finished at 47 percent from the field and 28 percent from the three - point line as a team . Robert Covington led the way , scoring 24 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 6 - 12 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) , to go along with two assists and three steals . It was the most points he 's scored since the beginning of February , as he matched a season - high in hitting six three - point shots.Covington did receive some help though , as Nerlens Noel finished with 16 points ( 7 - 13 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) , 12 rebounds and a blocked shot . Noel remains inconsistent with his scoring , but continues to dominate the boards and has grabbed double - digit rebounds in seven of his last eight games . He 's averaging 9 points and 8 rebounds on the season . The Sixers also got some help from the bench from rookie Jerami Grant . Grant went 5 - for - 7 from the field to score 13 points , while also adding two steals and four blocked shots in 29 minutes . He had gone a combined 1 - for - 7 from the field over his last two games , so it was good to see him get things turned around . Ish Smith added 10 points ( 3 - 11 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , five rebounds and nine assists off the bench as well . Despite taking the loss , DeMarcus Cousins had himself a monster game . Cousins went 12 - for - 24 from the field and 15 - for - 20 from the free throw line to score a game - high of 39 points , while also grabbing 24 rebounds in the process . Cousins continues to play well of late , as this was his fifth straight double - double . Over that five - game stretch , he 's averaging 25 points and 16 rebounds , as he 's one of the hottest players in the league . Rudy Gay also did his best in keeping the Kings close . In 40 minutes on the court , Gay finished with 24 points ( 7 - 17 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 9 - 10 FT ) and four rebounds . Like Cousins , he 's played extremely well over his last five games , averaging 28 points during that span , while shooting over 40 percent in each of those matchups as well.The only other King in double figures was Derrick Williams , who came off the bench for 15 points ( 5 - 9 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and three rebounds in 31 minutes . The Sixers ' next game will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday , while the Kings will travel to Washington to play the Wizards on Saturday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

With Tiago Splitter ( back/calf ) still sidelined , Austin Daye was given a spot start at power forward to matchup with the Suns ' small - ball power forward Markieff Morris . Daye played 19 minutes and finished with six points . Matt Bonner , who started the Spurs ' opener at center did not get off the bench against the Suns . Alex Len played a career - high 32 minutes and finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds to record the first double - double of his NBA career . Len did his damage off the bench , while starting center Miles Plumlee played just 15 minutes , a development that does n't mean much in the course of one game , but after the Suns invested a fifth - overall pick in the 2013 NBA Draft on Len , his development is something they 're going to be keen to push , and that may come at the expense of Plumlee at some point . Isaiah Thomas lead the Suns with a team - high 23 points off the bench . The Spurs have four days off before their next game at home Wednesday against the Atlanta Hawks . The Suns will finish a back - to - back set on the road Saturday against the Utah Jazz .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

The Lakers injury problems suffered a few more setbacks before the game wrapped up , as Kobe Bryant ( achilles ) left midway through the game to nurse his nagging achilles and rookie Larry Nance Jr. left with knee soreness after just three minutes of playing time . The beat up Lakers squad is far from an excuse for their play halfway through the season and the offensive miscues only add to their troubled year . Developing the young talent combination of Jordan Clarkson , Julius Randle and D'Angelo Russell does not seem to be the number one priority with the Kobe Bryant retirement tour in full swing , and the wasted experience will take its toll . Los Angeles turned to Lou Williams to score in volume , but managed 20 points on 15 shots and fell short of what was needed for his team to keep the game within reach at any point . Jordan Clarkson and D'Angelo Russell joined Williams in scoring double figures . The Lakers will look to get their 10th when they host the Houston Rockets ( 21 - 20 ) on Sunday . Utah has been experiencing a fair share of injury troubles as well , with both Trevor Booker ( concussion ) and Derrick Favors ( back ) , sidelined on Saturday . Favors missed his 13th consecutive game , and it is still unclear if their is another issue or if the Jazz are taking his return slowly . Rudy Gobert led the way with a monstrous performance , scoring 18 points , grabbing 18 rebounds and blocking five shots in 30 minutes . Gordon Hayward contributed 14 points , five rebounds and five assists , while four additional Jazz players finished in double figures ( Trey Lyles , Rodney Hood , Trey Burke and Joe Ingles ) in a strong team effort . Utah shot 49 percent from the floor and kept the game out of reach from the Lakers from the 2nd quarter on . Utah continues to battle for the 8 - seed in the Western Conference , and will look to pick up another win when they visit the Charlotte Hornets ( 18 - 22 ) on Monday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

Sacramento has won two straight games . They 've had a terrific start to the season and have n't shown any signs of slowing down . While DeMarcus Cousins ' line of 31 points and 18 rebounds is no great shock due to the frequency in which he put up such amazing lines , Ben McLemore 's 22 points and nine rebounds gave McLemore the best game of his young career . Even retread Derrick Williams got in on the funk train Saturday against his former team . Williams put up 12 points and six rebounds in 30 minutes . The Kings continue their road trip against the Pelicans in New Orleans on Tuesday . Minnesota has lost two straight and seven of their last eight games . Injuries can be blamed for the depth of the Timberwolves ' struggles this season , but they were never considered a team with much of a shot at a playoff spot in the stacked Western Conference . An argument could be made that the injuries the Timberwolves continue to suffer are a blessing in disguise considering that it 's forcing the team to give their young talent run against top - flight teams . Andrew Wiggins scored a career - high 29 points in 41 minutes Saturday . Mo Williams helped Wiggins get those points . Williams finished with 11 points and 12 assists for his second double - double in the last three games . The Timberwolves have three days off before hosting the Milwuakee Bucks on Wednesday . By Wednesday 's game , the Timberwolves expect to have Thaddeus Young ( personal ) and Nikola Pekovic ( wrist ) back in the active lineup .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

This game was simply a tough one for the 76ers , as they lost by 32 points , and could n't get much to go their way . They were without Nerlens Noel ( ankle ) in this one , and while the bench managed to score 44 points , the starters could n't all do their part . The team was led in scoring by Tony Wroten with 18 points ( 6 - 16 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 5 - 7 FT ) , and he chipped in five assists , three rebounds and a steal as well . Philadelphia also got solid production from big man Henry Sims with 12 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) , eight rebounds , three assists and one steal . The 76ers are off until Thursday , when they head to Dallas to take on the Mavericks and Dirk Nowitzki . The Raptors on the other side saw production come from all over the place , including deep into the bench . A total of 11 players scored for Toronto , and 13 players saw time on the court .

Julius Randle , alongside the Lakers youth , led the charge with an impressive all around performance against the Heat . Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade faced off for the last time , and the Staples Center energy was alive and well given the improvement Randle and D'Angelo Russell have shown through the past few week . Wade still has the clutch gene , and with 23 seconds left in overtime , he drove the lane and finished at the rim to tie the game at 100 points a piece , but Randle took what the defense gave him and showed off a filthy crossover - spin move combo , which led to the game winning floater with 2 seconds on the clock . D'Angelo Russell may be dealing with some disturbances in the locker room , but he was instrumental in the overtime period , as he scored on back - to - back possessions , even with the Miami Heat clawing back and finding a way to answer the Lakers surge . Kobe Bryant exited the game before the end of the first half and it was listed as general soreness . Jordan Clarkson led all scorers and provided needed free throws in the fourth quarter . The sophomore guard finished with 26 points , six rebounds and one assist , while Julius Randle added his 33rd double - double of the season with 13 points and 14 rebounds . Wade matched Clarkson 's 26 points , and added 10 rebounds and five assists to round out the box score , but it was Hassan Whiteside 's monstrous 18 points , 17 rebounds and seven blocks that stuck out the most . The Heat were thin in terms of the roster , and Whiteside technically came off the bench even though he registered 38 minutes of action . Luol Deng looked to bust out of his scoring slump , and provided 22 points and 11 rebounds in the loss , although the veteran is averaging his lowest point total since his rookie year . The Heat will head north and face the Sacramento Kings ( 30 - 45 ) on Friday , while the Lakers will enjoy a few days off before hosting the Boston Celtics ( 43 - 31 ) on Sunday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",

This game meant much more to the Bulls than Bucks and it was evident by the result . The second quarter is when Chicago made their mark , as they outscored Milwaukee 33 to 17 . The shooting was on point for the Bulls , as they made 53 percent of their shots and assisted on 30 of their 39 made baskets . This win brings the Bulls within two games of the eight - seed in the east , so it was obviously a crucial win . Jimmy Butler once again carried the torch , as he scored a team - high 25 points and also provided five rebounds and eight assists . Pau Gasol flirted with a triple - double , as he accumualted 16 points , eight rebounds and eight assists . Nikola mirotic gave the team a nice spark off the bench with 19 points and six rebounds . Up next for Chicago is a matchup with the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday . Milwaukee has been dominant at home , but these meaningless games are tough to get up for . Giannis Antetokonmpo was clearly game though , as he scored a game - high 34 points , while dishing out nine assists and grabbing five boards . Jabari Parker recorded a double - double , as he amassed 24 points and 11 rebounds .

The Warriors clinched the Western Conference long ago and at this point were just trying to stay healthy for the playoffs . In a somewhat meaningless game for Golden State , no starter played more than 20 minutes , and no bench players saw the floor for more than 25 minutes . Despite playing just 16 minutes , Klay Thompson managed to lead the Warriors with 25 points on 8 - for - 12 shooting from the field and 5 - for - 7 from downtown . Golden State will take on the New Orleans Pelicans ( 45 - 37 ) when the playoffs commence this weekend . The Nuggets ended a second straight disappointing season with a loss to the top - seeded Warriors .

Anthony Davis had a special game , in which he led his team in all five major statistical categories . He had 24 points , 11 rebounds , five assists , six blocks and two steals in a do - it - all performance . His play brought his team to the winner 's circle with a much needed victory to keep his team ahead of the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference playoff race . The Pelicans have the same record as the Thunder , but hold the tie - breaker and would be admitted into the playoffs if the teams wind up with identical records . The Timberwolves had a rough second quarter and could n't quite climb out of the hole against New Orleans . They went into halftime down by 15 after trailing the Pelicans by two heading into the second . Zach LeVine led Minnesota with 24 points and seven assists to go along with five rebounds for the rookie . Decimated by injuries , the Timberwolve 's frontcourt was manned heavily by Justin Hamilton , Adreian Payne and Arinze Onuaku . Those three combined for 18 points and 12 rebounds . Chase Budinger and Robbie Hummel helped pick up the slack . They had 29 points , 18 rebounds and five assists combined . Minnesota needs a win and a New York Knicks loss to avoid being the sole team with the worst record in the NBA this season . Minnesota will end their rebuilding year in Oklahoma City against the Thunder , as the Pelicans will travel to San Antonio to take on the Spurs on Wednesday . Each game has massive playoff implications . The Thunder need a win and a Pelicans loss . If the Pelicans win they secure the eighth seed . However , the Spurs are playing for the second seed in the Western Conference and likely wo n't rest their star players .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

Meanwhile , the red - hot Cavs will look to stretch their streak to seven games as they take on the Jazz on Tuesday in Cleveland .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",

The high - scoring affair was a testament to the reigning NBA champs ' ability to pull out a victory in almost any style of game . While the Warriors can certainly grind teams down with defense - - demonstrated Wednesday night when holding the Grizzlies to 85 points - - they 've also shown they can withstand a prolific offense performance from their opponent and still prevail . The latter was the case Thursday , with the Timberwolves getting productive nights out of multiple starters and reserves , yet still suffering a disheartening double - digit loss . Steph Curry led all scorers with 46 points on 15 - for - 25 shooting . It marked Curry 's second - highest scoring night of what is already an MVP-caliber season , and the 60 percent accuracy from the field was his third highest this season . Curry drained eight three - pointers on the night , tying a season high , at an impressive 62 percent clip . The remaining four Warriors starters also scored in double digits , led by Draymond Green 's 23 - point , 12 - rebound double - double . The Warriors are in first place in both the Pacific Division and Western Conference , sporting the best record in the league . They head home for a Saturday night tilt versus the Brooklyn Nets . The Timberwolves posted their second - highest scoring night of the season after 117 points in a surprising victory over the Hawks on Monday . Minnesota received double - digit scoring performances from starters Andrew Wiggins ( who returned from a one - game absence due to a knee injury ) , Zach LaVine ( who replaced the injured Ricky Rubio ) and rookie sensation Karl Anthony-Towns , who posted his fourth consecutive double - double and sixth overall on the season . The reserves also got in on the fun , led by Shabazz Muhammad ( 16 points ) and Kevin Martin ( 15 points ) . Backup center Gorgui Dieng and 17 - year veteran Andre Miller contributed a pair of 11 - point efforts . The Timberwolves dropped to 4 - 4 on the season and are in a three - way tie with the Utah Jazz and Denver Nuggets for second place behind the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They head to Indiana for the second game of a back - to - back versus the Pacers .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

The second game of a back - to - back for the Lakers proved to be a heavy workload , as the team looked tired throughout the second half . Kobe Bryant ( shoulder ) started , but only played the first half , likely to give the crowd a sendoff in his final game in Denver . It was far from a pretty showcase between the two teams , but the Lakers received another strong performance from rookie point guard D'Angelo Russell , who scored 24 points on 9 - of - 21 shooting , to go along with one rebound and six assists in 36 minutes . Russell has broken through in the second half of the season , and heading into Wednesday , he had posted a five game stretch averaging 21 points , 4 rebounds , 5 assists on 55 percent shooting . That stat line is the lone bright spot for Los Angeles aside from Brandon Bass ' defensive improvement over the last 10 games . Bass added 11 points on 4 - of - 7 shooting off the bench , but helped bring his team within striking distance of the Nuggets down the stretch , forcing a couple of turnovers and defending both the paint and wing at an exceptional level . Bryant five points in 10 minutes of game time , while Julius Randle fell short of a double - double with 17 points and seven rebounds . The Lakers will host the Atlanta Hawks ( 33 - 28 ) on Friday . The Nuggets held on to win , but it looked bleak after surviving an eight minutes stretch of play between the third and fourth quarters where they scored an underwhelming two points . Denver shot 1 - of - 12 during that stretch , and save for the Lakers inability to rebound the ball , the eight minute stretch could have been extended . The unlikely hero came on the back of D.J . Augustin , who rallied the Nuggets after the scoring drought and finished with 26 points , seven rebounds , five assists and one steal on 7 - of - 11 shooting in 23 minutes off of the bench . Emmanuel Mudiay put together a strong game , and the rookie matchup with Russell made for the most entertainment , as he rounded out the box score with 22 points , four rebounds and seven assists on 10 - of - 20 shooting . Gary Harris , Nikola Jokic and Kenneth Faried all finished in double figures in their starting roles . The Nuggets will host the Brooklyn Nets ( 17 - 44 ) on Friday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

The Hornets ' prized offseason acquisition , Nicolas Batum , left Wednesday night 's contest versus the Magic with an illness . That same malady extended into Thursday , opening up the starting opportunity for Jeremy Lin . The six - year pro had his best scoring game in over two years , tallying a game - high 35 points on outstanding 13 of 22 shooting from the field . The total included a pair of three - pointers , and was amassed over a robust 47 minutes . Lin 's previous scoring high on the season was 19 points , but the 27 - year - old showed that he is still highly capable of a breakout performance when given extended opportunity . The player who had considerable trouble defending Lin , DeMar DeRozan , nevertheless had a stellar offensive showing of his own . The Raptors ' shooting guard collected a team - high 31 points and added five assists , four rebounds , a steal and a block . The outing was DeRozan 's fifth consecutive game with 20 or more points . His trusty backcourt mate Kyle Lowry pitched in with 20 points , but needed an astounding amount of shot attempts to get there . Lowry was an atrocious 6 of 29 from the field , including 3 for 17 from beyond the arc . Bismack Biyombo and Terrence Ross both provided solid contributions , with the former accumulating a season - high 18 rebounds ( along with eight points ) , and the latter pouring in 17 points on the strength of a season - high five three - pointers . The Raptors fell to 16 - 11 but remain in first place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head to Miami to take on the Heat on Friday . Kemba Walker was the second member of the Hornets ' backcourt to spearhead Charlotte 's offensive attack , supporting Lin 's effort with 27 points of his own . He added seven assists , six rebounds , a pair of blocks and a steal . Marvin Williams contributed a 10 - point , 10 - rebound double - double , while P.J . Hairston pitched in with a second straight 14 - point performance that included a season - high four three - pointers . One of those long - range buckets came with 1:30 left in the overtime period and gave the home team a lead they would not relinquish . Spencer Hawes was highly productive off the bench , collecting a modest five points but hauling in an impressive 10 boards . He added four assists , three steals and a block in a highly efficient 23 minutes of action . The Hornets improved to 15 - 10 and currently reside in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They head to Washington for a Saturday night showdown with the Wizards .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

Watson ( foot ) also made his season debut , putting up nine points and four assists in 18 minutes off the bench . The Pacers will kick off a four - game road trip Saturday against the Cleveland Cavaliers . Orlando has dropped four straight games , including the first game of the six - game road trip they began in Indiana on Friday . The Pacers beat them on the boards , held them to 44 percent shooting from the field and also foced the Magic into 18 turnovers . Orlando 's roster got healthy over the last few games , and it seems their talent is having trouble finding out how to play together , though that should iron itself out as the season progresses . The Magic will take on the Suns in Phoenix on Sunday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

These days , it seems as if the Wizards ca n't buy a victory . Losers of three straight entering Saturday 's contest , Washington was trying to bounce back on their home court after enduring a 33 - point loss to the Celtics on Friday in which they 'd mustered a season - low 78 points . Although their offensive output was barely any better versus the Raptors , the Wizards had ridden an outstanding defensive effort to a 68 - 62 lead entering the final quarter . During that fourth period , the Raptors benefited from the hot shooting stroke of offensive linchpin Kyle Lowry , who scored eight of his game - high 27 points during that span and helped close the deficit to a razor - thin 82 - 81 with three seconds remaining . Then , on Toronto 's final possession , it was DeMar DeRozan who alertly was able to feed Cory Joseph in the left corner for a game - winning three - point shot as time expired . Lowry sunk six three - pointers as part of his offensive barrage , and kicked in seven rebounds , three assists , a pair of steals and a block in a highly productive 34 minutes against the normally stout defense of John Wall . In addition to his game - winning assist , DeRozan pitched in with 23 points after a slow first half , and added three rebounds and two assists . The performance marked the third consecutive game the standout shooting guard has scored 20 points or more . The rest of the Toronto starters were notably quiet with respect to points , but Bismack Biyombo provided what was likely one of the most productive scoreless outings in NBA history by hauling in 16 boards ( 15 on the defensive glass ) , and posting four blocks , a pair of assists and a steal . Joseph paced the Raptors ' bench with nine points , including his game - winning bucket from beyond the arc . Notably , Toronto escaped with the win despite committing 22 turnovers and having a slightly better shooting percentage from three - point range ( 46 ) than from the field ( 43 ) . The Raptors improved to 11 - 6 and currently have sole posession of first place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Divison . They head home for a date with the Phoenix Suns on Sunday . The Wizards once again were hampered by a lack of overall offense , despite the fact that four of their starting five tallied double - digit scoring nights . Bradley Beal led the way with a 20 - point effort that also featured six rebounds , six assists and three steals over 41 minutes . The boards equaled a season - high for Beal , while the assists were his second - best total on the year in that category . John Wall was able to contribute 18 points and supplement it with three rebounds , five assists and three steals . Marcin Gortat pitched in with a 16 - point , 10 - rebound double - double , while Otto Porter poured in 13 points . The sole holdout in single digits was spot starter Jared Dudley , who tallied seven points , four rebounds and two assists while taking Kris Humphries ' place in the lineup . The Wizards ' reserves could offer no help on this night however , with Humphries ' four points representing the bench 's highest scoring output . Washington fell to 6 - 8 and currently resides in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They head to Cleveland to face the Cavs on Tuesday .                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

Orlando was able to stay in the game through the first half , but Cleveland jumped out to a commanding 16 - point lead after outscoring the Magic 33 - 21 in the third quarter . Kevin Love had another solid game , draining six 3 - pointers and finishing with a game - high 34 points . The Cavaliers had perhaps their best shooting performance of the season , hitting 51 percent of their attempts from downtown ( 18 - of - 35 ) . It 's been an up - and - down season for Magic point guard Elfrid Payton , who went 0 - for - 7 from the field and finished with zero points in 19 minutes . With Payton the bench for most of the game , Shabazz Napier posted a season - high nine assists with 11 points over 29 minutes . The silver lining for Orlando was the play of power forward Andrew Nicholson , who scored a season - high 18 points off the bench . The Magic rotation has been very unpredictable lately with so many starters struggling , so that will likely mean more opportunities for guys like Napier and Nicholson moving forward . With the win , Cleveland kept it 's undefeated record at home in tact . In his second straight start in place of the injured Timofey Mozgov , Tristan Thompson registered a game - high 14 rebounds and came a point shy of a double - double for another night in a row . J.R. Smith continues to improve in each game and turned in a season - high 26 points ( 10 - 16 FG , 6 - 10 3Pt ) . LeBron James took a night off from scoring and decided to distribute a bit more , dishing out 13 assists as the Cavaliers put on a passing clinic finishing with 34 dimes . The Cavaliers get a tough test on the road Wednesday against the Raptors ; the Magic get the Knicks at home .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

First , rookie Mario Hezonja was the momentary hero , draining a clutch 26 - foot three - point jumper with 14 seconds remaining that finally gave the Magic a lead by the razor - thin margin of 101 - 100 . Three short seconds later , second - year forward Aaron Gordon fouled Paul Millsap , bringing the Hawks ' trusty veteran to the foul line . Millsap sunk his first free throw to tie the game at 101 , and then blocked Victor Oladipo 's nine - foot jumper with one second remaining to send the game into overtime . In the extra period however , Nikola Vucevic took matters into his own hands , scoring seven of the Magic 's first nine points to stake them to a 112 - 107 lead they would n't relinquish . Although Atlanta got as close as 112 - 110 after Kyle Korver 's three - pointer with 50 seconds remaining , Evan Fournier answered with his own trey at the 31 - second mark to extend Orlando 's lead back to five . Vucevic proved to be a Hawk killer for the second straight day on the stat sheet , amassing a team - leading 28 points , and adding 13 rebounds , six assists and a block . Elfrid Payton provided a very well - rounded stat line himself with 20 points , seven assists , four rebounds , three steals and a block . Fournier contributed 16 points overall , and also supplied four assists , three rebounds and three steals . Gordon chipped in with his second double - double in as many nights , recording 12 points , hauling in 10 boards , dishing out three assists and also recording a steal and a block . Jason Smith and Hezonja paced the bench with 14 points apiece . Smith also posted an assist , two steals and four blocks , while Hezonja added a career - high nine rebounds and three assists . The Magic are currently in a third - place tie with the Washington Wizards in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They head back home to await the San Antonio Spurs for a Wednesday tilt . Horford essentially matched Vucevic point - for - point , collecting 27 of his own and adding six rebounds , three assists and a pair of blocks . Millsap managed his first double - double since Jan. 27 , tallying 19 points , 13 rebounds , six assists , a block and four steals . Jeff Teague continued a recent stretch of resurgent offensive play with 21 points , five assists , three rebounds and a steal . Korver pitched in 16 points overall , including four of his trademark three - pointers . He also had a trio of boards , four assists and a pair of steals . Despite consecutive losses , Atlanta remains in a first - place tie with the Miami Heat atop the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They head to Chicago to take on the Bulls on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

The win coincidentally ended a seven - game win streak for OKC . Brooklyn sits at fourteenth in the Eastern Conference , leading only the league - worst Philadelphia 76ers ; however , they were able to come away with a win against one of the association 's stronger teams on Sunday . The Nets have been skidding all season , seeing coach Lionel Hollins fired and GM Billy King tender his resignation . On Sunday , they ended a slough of tough losses , advancing their record to 8 - 17 at home on the season . Star big man Brook Lopez caught fire on Sunday , pouring in a team - high 31 points while pulling down 10 rebounds . OKC defensive anchor Steven Adams sat out Sunday 's contest with an injured right elbow , allowing Lopez to take advantage of the defensive shortcomings of backup Enes Kanter . Lopez was aided , however , by the hustle of power forward Thaddeus Young . The veteran pulled down seven offensive rebounds and 14 boards in total , also notching 14 points , three assists , a block , and a steal . For Oklahoma City , the loss comes as a bit of a shock considering the tear that the team had found itself on . The Thunder boast the third - best record in the NBA , trailing only the historically good Warriors and Spurs . For Oklahoma City 's dynamic duo of superstars , Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant , it was business as usual on Sunday . The two combined for 59 points , 22 rebounds , and 14 assists . Both players were named starters for the Western Conference in this year 's All-Star game earlier this week . However , outside of the superstar tandem , only two Thunder players cracked double - digit scoring , recording 10 points apiece . OKC was edged out at the line and on the glass , as they allowed the Nets to pull down 18 offensive boards and 49 in total . The Thunder will try not to let the loss affect them as they travel to Madison Square Garden on Tuesday to take on the Knicks . The Nets , meanwhile , will play host to the Miami Heat on Tuesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",

Detroit has won seven straight road games , and after Wednesday 's 105 - 94 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans at home , Brandon Jennings decided to put the team on his shoulders Friday , scoring a season - high 37 points in 34 minutes . Andre Drummond put up 16 points and 16 rebounds and also tipped in the game - winning shot with 0 seconds left . After getting off to several slow starts recently , coach Stan Van Gundy brought up the possibility of making a change to his starting lineup coming into Friday 's game , but he opted to stick with the same starting lineup , and they got the job done . Indiana has dropped three straight games , losing to the Sixers , Timbwerolves and Pistons . George Hill will not play this weekend as he continues to work his way back from a groin injury , putting his return on tap for Monday 's game against the Rockets as his earliest possible return date . The Pacers had six players score in dougle digits Friday , with Roy Hibbert leading the way with a team - high 14 points . Indiana could n't defend the three - point line or keep the Pistons off the charity stripe .

Toronto got things off on the right foot , building a 31 - 20 lead after one quarter . However , the Hornets ( 24 - 32 ) put together a stellar defensive effort over the middle periods , limiting their hosts to just 27 points in the second and third quarters combined , while scoring 34 themselves in the third quarter alone . That surge gave them a seemingly dominant 75 - 58 edge heading into the final period , but the light went on for the Raptors at that point . They turned the tables on their visitors by limiting Charlotte to just 10 points in the fourth quarter and putting up 32 themselves , allowing them to escape with an improbable home victory and snap a three - game skid .

    "| 14  | November | 2016 | Monday    | 2016   | Staples Center            | Los Angeles    | California     | 19100      | 19000    | 2671    | At 31 years old , Chris Paul is beginning to make a case for this as the best season of his career . Heading into Monday 's matchup against Brooklyn , Paul was shooting a career - high 45 percent on three - point attempts , averaging a league - best 3 steals per game , and turning the ball over less than twice per game . In just 25 minutes on the floor Monday , Paul was able to improve all of those figures , going 4 - of - 6 from three and 8 - of - 11 overall , grabbing five steals , and turning the ball over just once . On top of that , Paul scored a team - high 21 points and dished out nine assists . It was another solid outing for the Clippers ' Blake Griffin as well , as the forward scored 20 points while grabbing six rebounds and recording six assists . On the opposing side , Nets ' guard Bojan Bogdanovic stepped into a leading role for the shorthanded Nets ' offense . Bogdanovic led the team with 18 points on 8 - of - 11 shooting . Former No . 1 overall pick Anthony Bennett did not enjoy the same success , however , as he shot just 2 - of - 8 from the field .The host Los Angeles Clippers demolished the Brooklyn Nets , 127 - 95 , at Staples Center on Monday night . The Clippers ( 10 - 1 ) became the first team to reach 10 wins on the season with Monday 's victory , and have made quick work of most teams on their run . One of the key factors to their success has been its league - best defense , which was on full display against Brooklyn . The Clippers held their opponents to 44 percent shooting and forced 21 turnovers on the night . Big man Mo Speights provided an extra defensive boost for LA , recording two steals and three blocks off the bench . Defense was n't the only story , however , as the Clippers were able to score a ridiculous 127 points on 53 percent shooting . Point guard Chris Paul led the offense with 21 points and nine assists , while All-Star power forward Blake Griffin trailed not far behind with 20 points and six assists . Los Angeles was able to score seemingly at will from beyond the three - point line , as the team shot 56 percent from three - point range . Brooklyn ( 4 - 6 ) , meanwhile , was bitten with the injury bug prior to the contest . Point guard Jeremy Lin ( hamstring ) as well as backup Isaiah Whitehead ( concussion ) were sidelined , while star center Brook Lopez was given the game off to rest . The absence of key players did the Nets no favors , as the team struggled mightily on both ends of the floor . Former No . 1 overall pick turned D-League call - up , Anthony Bennett was forced to play 26 minutes , shooting just 2 - of - 8 during that stretch .

But they were able to kick it up a notch in the third quarter and outscore the Knicks by 13 in the period , and they were able to take care of business from there .

Michael Carter-Williams also continued his strong play as of late , scoring 19 points ( 8 - 13 FG ) , seven assists and four steals in 31 minutes . In his last two games , Carter-Williams has now combined for 49 points and 15 assists . As a team , the Bucks recorded an astounding 17 steals , and the victory keeps them in sixth place in the Eastern Conference . For now , they sit there comfortably with a two - game lead for that position with just three games remaining in the regular season . The dreadful season for the Knicks continues , as this loss is their 11th in their last 12 games . Langston Galloway was once again solid in the losing effort , scoring 20 points on 8 - of - 16 shooting in 35 minutes . Four other New York players scored in double figures , with Lance Thomas ( 16 ) , Shane Larkin ( 14 ) , Jason Smith ( 11 ) and Lou Amundson ( 10 ) rounding out the five total . Andrea Bargnani sat out this game with an illness . The Knicks recorded a dreadful 24 turnovers to just 22 assists , and they continue to boast the worst record in the NBA this season .

Charlotte drew a matchup with the East 's top team at the right time , with Atlanta resting four starters and Jeff Teague sitting out with a sprained ankle . The Hawks ' reserves - turned - starters fared well against the Hornets , but the Hornets ' lineup proved to be too much in the end . The Hawks cut the lead to single - digits in the fourth , but the Hornets , led by Mo Williams ' shooting , put them away . Williams finished with 18 points off the bench and made four of his five attempts from beyond the arc . The Hornets lead the season series 2 - 1 and they will meet one last time during the regular season on April 10 .

As a result , coach Mike Budenholzer did n't feel pressed to deploy his starters for the second game of a back - to - back set .

The game was a tale of two halves , as these teams showed why they have struggled so much this season . The Nuggets scored 64 points in the first half to take a 13 - point lead , but blew it in the second half with some bad defense . The Lakers outscored Denver 32 - 16 in the third quarter and went to Kobe Bryant to close things out at the end . Denver made some crucial errors late and it really hurt them in a game they really should have won . It was a vintage Kobe performance , as he carried the Lakers to a much needed win . He matched his season - high with 31 points and hit multiple baskets late to seal the victory . Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams both played good as well , as they scored 36 points combined . The offense has been terrible all season , for the Lakers , but this 111 - spot will hopefully get them going . Their next game will be on Christmas , when they take on the Los Angeles Clippers . The Nuggets had a season - high 21 - point lead in the second quarter , but managed to choke that away . They let the Lakers go on a 23 - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that . Will Barton scored 18 points in the first quarter , but really struggled after that , finishing with 25 in the game . The one bright spot was the bench , as all four players who came off the bench scored at least nine points while accumulating 58 points all together . Denver also played this game without Danilo Gallinari and that might have been the key in the loss with no go - to weapon at the end of the game . This was a brutal loss for Nuggets fans and they 'll look to bounce - back on Wednesday when they take on the Phoenix Suns .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

LeBron James ' homecoming did n't end the way he 'd probably imagined , and it appears James is trying to fit into the Cavaliers ' new offense as merely one of the cogs . He played 43 minutes but finished with just 17 points , which is more than 10 points off his career per - game average of 28 points . Kevin Love met his skeptics face - to - face , putting up a Love-like line of 19 points and 14 rebounds in 38 minutes . The Cavaliers used a nine - man rotation and leaned heavily on the starters in their first regular season game under new coach David Blatt . James , Love , Kyrie Irving , and Dion Waiters all played at least 38 minutes , while the minutes at center were split between starter Anderson Varejao ( 27 ) and backup center Tristan Thompson ( 20 ) . After looking like a lottery - bound team following their drubbing by the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday , the Knicks surprised everyone by pulling out a win over Cavaliers on Thursday . Carmelo Anthony played 34 minutes and finished with 25 points and six assists . Quincy Acy moved into the starting lineup at power forward , pushing Amar'e Stoudemire to a bench role . Acy played 22 minutes and finished with eight points and 10 rebounds . The Knicks leaned heavliy on their bench , with 10 players seeing at least 13 minutes of action Thursday . Starting center Samuel Dalembert played just six minutes and was replaced in the starting lineup in the second half by Jason Smith . The Cavaliers ' next game is on the road Friday against the Chicago Bulls .

Kyle O'Quinn led the bench , providing 16 points , six rebounds , three assists and four blocks .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",
    "| 16  | December | 2015 | Wednesday | 2015   | Madison Square Garden     | New York City  | New York       | 19800      | 19800    | 1735    | The Knicks ( 12 - 14 ) defeated the Timberwolves ( 9 - 16 ) by a score of 107 - 102 at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday . Minnesota was able to cut New York 's lead to three with 11 seconds remaining , but too many fouls earlier on in the fourth quarter put the game out of reach . The Knicks last 13 points all came from the charity stripe as Carmelo Anthony had perhaps his most well - rounded game of the season , scoring 20 points ( 6 - 15 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 7 - 8 FT ) with 15 rebounds , nine assists and four turnovers . Melo was a perfect 6 - for - 6 on crucial free throws late in the game . Timberwolves point guard Ricky Rubio came a point and two steals away from making history . He finished the game with nine points on 3 - of - 10 shooting from the field , 12 assists , 10 rebounds and eight steals , but was unable to complete the illusive quadruple - double . Karl-Anthony Towns got the best of his rookie counterpart Kristaps Porzingus , scoring a team - high 25 points ( 11 - 21 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) while pulling down 10 rebounds for his 11th double - double of the season . Andrew Wiggins also chipped in 23 points . Overshadowed by Anthony 's big performance was Aaron Afflalo 's game - high 29 points ( 9 - 14 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt , 8 - 9 FT ) . Afflalo did most of his work in the low post surprisingly and he had no trouble making easy work of a soft T-Wolves defense . It was playing with the second unit off the bench that really sparked Afflalo towards his big night . The Knicks still need to stay more consistent on the offensive end and barely escaped with a victory after blowing a 20 - point lead at halftime .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

The Jazz continued their strong play of late , recording their second straight win and seventh of their last ten . Despite the loss , the Nets actually were the superior shooters in this one , going 50 percent from the field and 53 percent from the three - point line , while the Jazz finished at 47 percent from the floor and 46 percent from deep . What may have been the deciding factor were free throws though . The Jazz converted on 17 - of - 21 , while the Nets shot just 11 and converted on only four of those 11 attempts . As has been the case for the Jazz all season , both Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors did the bulk of the work offensively . Hayward finished with a team - high of 24 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 8 - 9 FT ) , while adding five rebounds and three steals as well . It was his second impressive performance in a row , as he 's combined for 49 points , 14 rebounds , five assists and four steals over his last two . He 's now averaging 20 points and 5 rebounds on the year . Favors , on the other hand , posted 22 points ( 8 - 16 FG , 6 - 8 FT ) , eight rebounds and four assists in 37 minutes . He 's also played very well of late , averaging 19 points and 7 rebounds over his last four games . Rookie Dante Exum had one of the better games of his career , notching double figures in points for just the seventh time this season and first since the end of January . He went 5 - for - 6 from the field and a perfect 4 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 14 points , while adding four assists as well . The only other Jazz player to reach double - digit points was Trey Burke , who came off the bench for 12 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt ) and four assists in 20 minutes . The Nets really struggled to score in this one , with just three players reaching double figures in points . One of those players was Brook Lopez , who took over the starting center spot for Mason Plumlee , as Plumlee was put back into a bench role . In 35 minutes , Lopez scored 19 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 3 - 5 FT ) , to go along with 10 rebounds and two blocked shots . It was his second double - double in a row , as he 's combined for 38 points and 23 rebounds over that span . He 's now averaging 16 points and 7 rebounds on the season . Along with Lopez , Thaddeus Young also moved into the starting lineup Sunday , pushing Alan Anderson to the bench . He matched a team - high with 19 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt ) , while also adding three rebounds and four steals in 32 minutes . With such a strong performance , he should continue to start for the forseeable future . Coming off the bench , Bojan Bogdanovic added 11 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 3 - 4 3Pt ) in 21 minutes . Both Joe Johnson and Deron Williams struggled in this one , scoring nine and six points respectively . The Jazz 's next game will be at home against the New York Knicks on Tuesday , while the Nets will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

The Pistons took a 10 - point lead in the third quarter and looked poised to run away with it , but the Nets bench led by Andrea Bargnani put the Nets back on top early in the fourth quarter . It remained tight throughout the fourth quarter , as neither team managed more than a five - point lead at any point in the period , but Detroit 's one - two punch of Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson proved to be too tough for the Nets . Drummond finished with his third double - double in his past four games as he scored a team - high 21 points and grabbed a game - high 18 rebounds , including seven on the offensive end . Jacksom scored 19 and dished out six assists , and Ersan Ilyasova and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 16 apiece . The Pistons shot poorly ( 43 percent ) but used a ridiculous 19 offensive rebounds to keep their offense from going stagnant . Brook Lopez was ultra - efficient , as he scored a game - high 27 points on 13 - 19 shooting and grabbed five rebounds . Bargnani scored 18 off the bench on 7 - 12 shooting , but Wayne Ellington ( 4 - 11 FG , 3 - 5 3PT ) was the only other Nets player to reach double - digits with 11 . The Nets shot 49 percent from the floor , well above the Pistons ' mark , but thanks to their work on the glass , Detroit took 16 more field goals ( 98 ) than Brooklyn ( 82 ) , and that proved to be the difference in the game . The Pistons will continue their east coast road trip Wednesday in Boston . The Nets will continue their homestand with a Wednesday game against the Pacers .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

Both teams came into the game heading in opposite directions , making the final result all the more improbable . The Celtics had won nine of their last 10 games , and were riding a four - game winning streak that included a last - second victory over the Cavaliers . Meanwhile , Milwaukee came in as losers of five straight , and opted to shake up their starting five in advance of their tilt with Boston . Michael Carter-Williams and Greg Monroe headed to the second unit for the night , replaced at point guard and center by O.J . Mayo and Miles Plumlee , respectively . The first quarter went as expected , with visitors emerging with a 30 - 26 lead . However , the Bucks hung tough in the second period , and came out of intermission a different team . They doubled up the Celtics 40 - 20 in the third quarter , allowing them to take a seemingly safe 93 - 74 lead into the final 12 minutes . Boston had different ideas , turning the tables on Milwaukee in the fourth period , and managing to finally knot the game up at 111 with one second left after a pair of Kelly Olynyk free throws . Against all odds , Milwaukee found themselves with a chance to avoid overtime just four - tenths of a second later , in the form of Khris Middleton standing at the foul line . In an ironic twist , Avery Bradley , Boston 's hero in the aformentioned win over Cleveland , fouled Middleton as he tried to defend his last - second desperation shot , and the Bucks ' shooting guard sank the first free throw to seal the one - point win . The Celtics were led by a pair of 18 - point efforts from Bradley and Jae Crowder , who continues to play through a high ankle sprain . The former added four rebounds , four assists and a pair of steals , while the latter provided five rebounds , two assists and two steals . Isaiah Thomas registered 15 points , and supplemented it with a pair of assists and a pair of steals . Jared Sullinger only pitched in four points , but did add 11 rebounds and five assists . The bench was also highly productive on the night , with three players tallying double - digit scoring . Olynyk led the reserves with 15 points , three rebounds and a steal , while Jonas Jerebko managed 13 points and five boards . Marcus Smart collected 12 points of his own , and complemented it with four rebounds , two assists and two steals . Boston remains in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head back home to face off with the Clippers on Wednesday . Middleton was both the hero and the Bucks ' leading scorer among the starting five , posting 20 points , five rebounds and five assists . Giannis Antetokounmpo was next with 14 points , three rebounds , two assists , two steals and a trio of blocks . Jabari Parker bounced back from two sub - par outings with 10 points , three boards , two assists and a steal . Monroe responded to his demotion with a breakout 29 - point , 12 - rebound double - double off the bench that also included three assists , a steal and a pair of rejections . Carter-Williams also appeared motivated by his ouster from the first unit , contributing 16 points , six rebounds , five assists and a steal over 26 minutes . Jerryd Bayless was the third reserve with double - digit scoring , totaling 14 points , a rebound and two assists . Milwaukee remains in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division despite the win . They 're home again Thursday for a showdown with the Washington Wizards . |\n",

The Thunder picked up a much - needed win on the back of Russell Westbrook as they fight to keep their playoff hopes in the Western Conference alive . Westbrook scored and shot the ball well Friday night , posting a game - high 27 points ( 11 - 19 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt ) , 10 assists and five rebounds in 38 minutes . Enes Kanter also continued his strong offensive play , scoring 25 points ( 9 - 14 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 6 - 8 FT ) and grabbing six rebounds in 32 minutes . Kanter is now averaging 22 points 12 rebounds in the month of April . Dion Waiters played one of his best games of the season , scoring 22 points ( 9 - 19 FG ) in 40 minutes , while Anthony Morrow scored 19 points ( 7 - 17 FG , 5 - 10 3Pt ) and grabbed six rebounds in 26 minutes off the bench . The win keeps Oklahoma City in the playoff hunt , but they are currently on the outside looking in . Despite holding the same record as the Pelicans for the final spot in the West , New Orleans holds the tiebreaker , so the Thunder will have to hope the Pelicans lose one of their final three games to even have a chance . The Kings are well out of the playoff race and ca n't stay healthy as they close out the regular season . Both DeMarcus Cousins ( foot ) and Rudy Gay ( head ) sat out for the second consecutive game , leaving Sacramento without their two best offensive players . Ben McLemore led the way for the Kings in the losing effort , scoring 20 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 4 - 10 3Pt ) in 35 minutes . His running - mate in the backcourt , Ray McCallum , posted a solid stat line of 17 points ( 8 - 11 FG ) , six rebounds and four assists in 38 minutes . Filling in for Gay , Omri Casspi scored a solid 15 points ( 4 - 9 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 5 - 8 FT ) and grabbed six rebounds in 28 minutes , while Jason Thompson , filling in for Cousins , scored just five points but managed to grab 14 rebounds in 26 minutes . Derrick Williams ( 17 ) was the only other Kings player to score in double figures Friday . Up next , the Thunder will travel to Indiana Sunday to play the Pacers , while the Kings will head to Denver and take on the Nuggets on Sunday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

Both teams have already clinched a playoff berth in their respective conferences , but it was the Cavaliers who were able to continue with their momentum , winning their fourth straight game Wednesday . They continue to sit as the second seed in the East , eight games back from the Atlanta Hawks . The Grizzlies , on the other hand , remain second in the West , and sit eight and a half games back from the Golden State Warriors . The Cavaliers were the superior shooters in this game , going 51 percent from the field and 41 percent from the three - point line , while the Grizzlies finished at 44 percent from the floor and just 24 percent from deep . While they only received 18 combined points from their bench , the Cavaliers ' starters all had big games , with each finishing in double figure points . Kyrie Irving led the way with 24 points ( 9 - 21 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) , while also contributing two assists and two steals . It was his second solid performance in a row , as he 's now combined for 44 points , nine assists and four steals over his last two games . Kevin Love looked as if he could n't miss a shot , going 10 - for - 13 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 22 points , to go along with 10 rebounds and two blocked shots . Despite averaging 17 points on the season , he had n't surpassed the 11 - point mark in four games , so it was good to see him finally break out and have a solid game .

Over his last three games , he 's now averaging 26 points , 8 rebounds , 5 assists and 2 steals .

He 's riding a nice two - game stretch , combining for 39 points and 11 rebounds .

He went 7 - for - 10 from the field to score 15 points , while playing just 21 minutes . It was his highest point total since the end of January , as it marked one of the few bright spots in this game for the Grizzlies . Also coming off the bench , Jeff Green chipped in with 11 points ( 4 - 11 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and five rebounds . The Cavaliers ' next game will be on the road against the Brooklyn Nets on Friday , while the Grizzlies will be at home against the Golden State Warriors on Friday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

Portland clinched the Northwest Division shortly before tip - off after Oklahoma City fell to Memphis , but that did n't stop the Trail Blazers from putting the exclamation point on the night . The Trail Blazers started hot and finished hot , outscoring the Lakers 26 - 12 in the first quarter and 33 - 14 in the fourth . Second-year guard C.J McCollum poured in a team - high 27 points in 27 minutes off the bench . With Friday 's win , the Trail Blazers completed the season sweep over the Lakers . Portland had n't won a division title outright since the 1998 - 99 season when it was a member of the Pacific Division . Damian Lillard posted 20 points on an efficient 8 - of - 15 shooting performance that included going 4 - of - 8 from beyond the arc . The Trail Blazers currently hold the fourth spot in the Western Conference , but have one less win than the Clippers and Spurs . The division title looms large in this case as the Warriors have already clinched the Clippers ' division and the Spurs have an uphill climb to unseat the Grizzlies and Rockets in the Southwest . The Trail Blazers will play the second half of a back - to - back set Saturday when they host the Pelicans . Los Angeles ' season - long woes continued Friday with another blowout loss in front of the home crowd . Friday 's defeat tied a not - so - prestigious franchise record for most losses in a single season . The Lakers are almost assured to have one of the bottom - five records in the league this season , which should allow them to have a top - five pick in the upcoming draft . Jordan Clarkson was again one of the few bright spots for the Lakers as he led them in scoring with 27 points . Clarkson also pulled down seven rebounds and dished out five assists in 35 minutes of action .

    "| 14  | February | 2017 | Tuesday   | 2016   | Target Center           | Minneapolis   | Minnesota    | 17700      | 19000    | 3558    | The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 116 - 108 Tuesday at Target Center . The Timberwolves ( 21 - 35 ) managed to keep pace with the East-leading Cavaliers ( 38 - 16 ) for a majority of Tuesday 's contest , and they were well within striking distance down the final stretch of the game . That was until LeBron James hit a step back three - pointer with two minutes remaining to take his team 's lead from three points to six . At that point , Minnesota was finished . James finished with 25 points on an efficient 10 - of - 14 shooting from the field to go along with 14 assists and eight rebounds as the Cavaliers walked out of the Target Center with their second straight victory and their sixth win in their last seven games . Kyrie Irving added 25 points of his own , Channing Frye posted a double - double of 21 points and 10 rebounds as Kevin Love 's replacement and the newest Cavalier , Derrick Williams , came off the bench to score 13 points Tuesday . As for those Timberwolves , a brilliant performance from Andrew Wiggins ended up not being enough for a team that has lacked a strong supporting cast all season . After scoring 20 points in the third quarter , Wiggins finished the game with 41 points on 16 - of - 29 shooting from the field . Karl-Anthony Towns had yet another productive night as well , scoring 26 points and grabbing eight rebounds , but besides those two , Minnesota failed to get much else offensively from their team . Ricky Rubio did manage to dish out a game - high 16 assists and grab eight rebounds , but he was n't able to produce enough in the scoring column , ending with just five points on 2 - of - 8 shooting from the field . Up next , the Cavaliers will look to continue to build on their lead in the Eastern Conference on Wednesday against the Pacers , while the Timberwolves will travel to Denver on Wednesday to take on the Nuggets .This season , Ricky Rubio has proven to be a crucial member of Minnesota 's offense with no legitimate backup point guards and now without the services of Zach LaVine ( knee ) . However , while Rubio has been putting up big - time assist numbers as of late , he remains a liability scoring - wise . Tuesday 's performance was yet another example for the Spaniard , as he posted a game - high 16 assists , which was his highest total since he dished out 17 on Jan. 11 against the Rockets . And while Rubio did an adequate job of getting his teammates involved , he struggled to get himself involved , scoring just five points on 2 - of - 8 shooting from the field . This was n't an aberration for the point guard either , as it was the seventh time this season that Rubio was able to record double - digit assists but not reach double - digit points .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

It was a big night for two Blazers in particular , as center Jusuf Nurkic and guard C.J . McCollum combined for 72 points for Portland ( 36 - 38 ) . Nurkic contributed a career - high scoring output of 33 points to go along with a whopping 16 rebounds and three blocks . The output came against his former team , from whom he was traded at the deadline . Nurkic was absolutely deadly from the field , shooting 12 - of - 15 from the field and 9 - of - 11 at the free - throw line . McCollum , meanwhile , shot 15 - of - 24 for a game - high 39 points . The two were the centers of a red - hot Blazers offense , as the team shot over 49 percent from the field and reached the line 33 times on the night . Denver ( 35 - 39 ) , meanwhile , saw slightly more balanced production from their scorers . Six Nuggets scored in double figures , and their own young big man nearly recorded a triple - double . Sophomore center Nikola Jokic cleaned up , recording 17 points , eight rebounds , and eight assists . However , the team simply could not slow down the two hot scorers for Portland . Foul trouble proved problematic as well , as the Nuggets got to the line 20 times but gave up 33 free - throws to Portland . The game was hugely impactful on the playoff standings , as Portland was able to pass Denver for eighth in the conference thanks to the win . Portland will host Houston on Wednesday , while Denver will visit Charlotte on Thursday .It was a huge night for Portland 's young stars , and in particular , recently acquired big man Jusuf Nurkic . Nurkic had a career - high 33 points on 12 - of - 15 shooting and 9 - of - 11 at the free - throw line against his former team . Offense was n't the only thing Nurkic provided , though , as he pulled down a whopping 16 rebounds to go along with two steals and three blocks . The young center continues to grow in his new starting role with Portland . Nurkic was not even his team 's high scorer , however , as shooting guard C.J . McCollum exploded for 39 points . McCollum shot 15 - of - 24 from the field and splashed home three three - pointers on the night . In addition , McCollum had five rebounds , three assists , and went 6 - of - 6 at the free - throw line . For Denver , young big man Nikola Jokic made an impact with 17 points , eight rebounds , and eight assists . Veteran starter Jameer Nelson also contributed somewhat surprisingly with a team - high 23 points on the night .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

Despite both teams having already been eliminated from playoff contention , this still marked a hard fought game between these Western Conference rivals . The Kings came out as the superior shooters in this one , going 53 percent from the field and 38 percent from the three - point line , while the Timberwolves finished at 48 percent from the floor and just 32 percent from deep . Also helping push the Kings to a win was their rebounding , as they finished with a 49 - 36 advantage . With DeMarcus Cousins sidelined because of a foot injury , it was Rudy Gay and Omri Casspi who really stepped up and had huge games . Gay finished with 33 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 13 - 15 FT ) , seven rebounds and five assists , while Casspi posted 31 points ( 12 - 20 FG , 4 - 6 3Pt , 3 - 5 FT ) and five rebounds . Casspi had far - and - away his best performance of the season , as he 's really picked it up lately . Over his last four games , he 's averaging 20 points , while shooting an impressive 57 percent from the field . Gay , on the other hand , is on fire as well , combining to go 19 - of - 35 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from deep for 57 points over his last two outings . He 's now pushed his season averages to 21 points and 6 rebounds per game on the season . Coming off the bench , Derrick Williams had a strong showing as well . He went 8 - for - 12 from the field to score 18 points , while adding eight rebounds over 31 minutes as well . The 18 points matched a season - high for the forward , as it was one of his better outings of the year . Despite being unable to limit the Kings ' offense , the Timberwolves nearly pulled off the victory due to some strong offensive performances of their own . Kevin Martin had the most impressive line , finishing with 37 points ( 13 - 31 FG , 3 - 11 3Pt , 8 - 11 FT ) and eight assists . It was a season - high in field goal attempts for the guard , who had a slightly better performance than he did on Friday , where he went just 3 - of - 12 from the field . He 's now averaging 20 points on the season and will continue to get off a ton of shots due to the vast amount of injuries the Timberwolves are dealing with . Rookie Andrew Wiggins had a big game as well though , recording 26 points ( 11 - 20 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) and eight rebounds .

Houston got out to a fast start , taking a commanding 44 - 18 lead by the 11 - minute mark in the second quarter . The Thunder cut the Rockets ' lead to 10 early in the fourth , but Houston answered with a 120 run to effectively close out Oklahoma City . Houston ended the game shooting 47 % from the floor , but was shooting above 50 % for much of the contest . Oklahoma City came out flat after a long rest , having last played on Friday against Utah . Things wo n't get much easier for the Thunder , who host the Warriors on Friday before going on a five - game road trip next week against the likes of the Wizards and Hawks . Oklahoma City is now three and a half games behind Phoenix for the eighth seed in the West . Houston has now won both games against Oklahoma City this season , although Thursday 's contest was drastically different than the 69 - 65 game in November where both teams shot under 30 % from the floor . Point guard Patrick Beverley , who suffered a knee contusion Wednesday , was able to play 32 minutes and finished with 13 points and five rebounds . James Harden finished one rebound shy of a triple - double as he dropped 31 points , 10 assists , and nine rebounds on the Thunder .

Both teams came into the game with notable changes to their respective starting lineups . Atlanta ( 24 - 17 ) gave Dwight Howard the afternoon off for rest , which slid Paul Millsap over to center and Thabo Sefolosha to power forward , as Mike Muscala was unavailable due to an ankle injury suffered Sunday . Meanwhile , the Knicks ( 18 - 24 ) replaced Courtney Lee with Ron Baker at the two - guard spot , and brought Mindaugas Kuzminskas into the starting five as well with Lance Thomas unavailable due to a broken orbital bone and possible concussion brought about by a Jonas Valanciunas elbow a day prior . Carmelo Anthony shifted to power forward in place of Kristaps Porzingis , who was once again absent due to his sore Achilles . The personnel shifts did n't affect the quality of play in the least , and in fact , may have enhanced it . The two teams engaged in an entertaining back - and - forth battle that was n't decided until the final seconds , when a Joakim Noah shot attempt failed to find the net . Dennis Schroder , who had endured a rough couple of games coming in to Monday , had given the Hawks what would be their final margin of victory with a 25 - foot three - pointer jumper with 22 seconds remaining . A revitalized Schroder led Atlanta with 28 points overall , a total he supplemented with three rebounds and three assists . Tim Hardaway , Jr. checked in second with 20 points , four assists , three rebounds and a steal . Millsap was effective at the five , posting 17 points , seven rebounds , six assists , three steals and three blocks . Kent Bazemore followed up a strong Sunday showing with 16 points , six rebounds , five assists and a steal . Kris Humphries got extra run off the bench with Muscala out and led the second unit with 14 points , seven boards , an assist and a steal . The Knicks were paced by Carmelo Anthony , who went off for 30 points , seven rebounds , two assists and a steal . Derrick Rose followed with a near double - double consisting of 18 points , nine assists , four rebounds , a steal and a block . Kuzminskas supplied 14 points , five rebounds , two assists and a pair of steals . Noah registered a modest seven points but hauled in 17 boards , while also providing three assists , two blocks and a steal . Justin Holiday led the bench with 11 points and four rebounds . The Hawks continue on the road and next head to the Motor City , where they 'll face the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night . The Knicks make the short trip to Boston to tangle with the Celtics that same evening .Dennis Schroder 's 28 points led the Hawks , and his three - pointer with 22 seconds remaining ended up being the game - winning basket . Tim Hardaway , Jr. checked in second with 20 points , while Paul Millsap drew the start at center for Dwight Howard ( rest ) and posted 17 points , seven rebounds , six assists , three steals and three blocks . Kent Bazemore followed with 16 points , and Kris Humphries led the second unit with 14 points . Carmelo Anthony 's 30 points led New York , and Derrick Rose followed with a near double - double consisting of 18 points , nine assists , four rebounds , a steal and a block .

Midway through the third quarter , it looked like the Warriors were going to run away with the game , maintaining a double - digit lead through the first six or so minutes . However , the Clippers were able to make a run late in the quarter to take a one - point lead into final period . From there , it was the Stephen Curry show . While Los Angeles managed to keep it close through the final 12 minutes , they simply had no answer for last year 's MVP . Curry scored 13 points in the fourth quarter and finished with 31 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 7 - 11 3Pt ) for the game in 33 minutes . Harrison Barnes also came up big in the fourth quarter , scoring 10 straight points at one point and finishing with a team - high nine rebounds in 36 minutes . Klay Thompson 's clutch free throws put the game out of reach , and his block on Jamal Crawford in the closing seconds sealed the deal . He finished with 16 points in 32 minutes . For the Clippers , Chris Paul and Blake Griffin did everything they could to keep their team in the game , but in the end , it just was n't enough . Griffin stuffed the stat sheet , scoring 23 points , grabbing 10 rebounds and dishing out six assists in 38 minutes , while Paul managed a team - high 24 points and nine assists in 29 minutes . DeAndre Jordan recorded a double - double of 11 points and 13 rebounds . Up next , the Warriors will stay at home to play the Nuggets on Thursday , while the Clippers will head home Friday to face the Rockets .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

The Raptors made a change to their starting lineup , moving James Johnson into the starting small forward spot and shifting Greivis Vasquez back to a bench role . Johnson capitalized on the promotion to score a game - high 20 points in 30 minutes . Vasquez played 16 minutes off the bench and put up five points and two assists . It was a gritty game , with both teams shooting 43 percent or worse from the floor . The Raptors pulled away from the Spurs thanks to their work at the free - throw line . DeMar DeRozan led the charge there , marching to the line to convert 10 - of - 12 attempts . The Spurs could n't buy a shot , shooting 33 percent from the field and 25 percent from beyond the arc . Tim Duncan and Marco Belinelli tied for a team - high 12 points , illustrating the Spurs ' futility on offense . Toronto is in second place in the Eastern Conference , but they sit seven games behind the conference - leading Hawks . The Raptors will host the Wizards on Wednesday . San Antonio sits in seventh place in the Western Conference standings , 4 games ahead of the eighth place Suns .

    "| 21  | November | 2015 | Saturday  | 2015   | American Airlines Arena | Miami         | Florida      | 19700      | 19600    | 1567    | The Miami Heat ( 8 - 4 ) held off the Philadelphia 76ers ( 0 - 14 ) to win 96 - 91 on Saturday . This was the Sixers best chance at a win all season , but they could n't quite hold off the Heat . Miami ended the game on a 20 - 4 run and held the Sixers to one basket over the final seven - plus minutes . Not to mention , that one basket was a meaningless one with just seconds left in the game . The Heat held the Sixers to 38 percent shooting and blocked 14 shots in the win . Philadelphia 's bench was a bright spot though , as they outscored Miami 's bench 47 to 26 . This was a rough loss in a disastrous season for Philadelphia . They had a big lead early , but simply could n't hold on . They did get two great bench performances , as Robert Covington dropped 21 points while Isiah Caanan dropped 22 points . Philadelphia 's best player on this night was rookie Jahlil Okafor , who tallied 16 points , 11 rebounds and three steals en route to a double - double . The rookie now leads the team in scoring and is second on the team in rebounding . They might have their best chance at a win when they take on the equally - young Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday . The Heat looked horrible in the first half , but leaned on their stifling defense to pull out a big win . Miami got an outstanding performance from Dwyane Wade , who tallied 27 points , seven rebounds , four assists and three steals in the victory . Hassan Whiteside also had a great game , as he collected 13 points , nine rebounds and eight blocks in the win . Those eight blocks add to his already league - leading total and he 's truly playing at a different level this season than years past . This is one of the best defenses in the NBA right now and they showed why on Saturday . Miami will look to keep up their strong defense against the surging New York Knicks on Monday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

After being out - scored by 20 points in the second quarter , the Sixers had themselves in a hole , as they were down 64 - 51 at the half . They came out with a big third quarter though , where they out - scored the Kings 37 - 18 to give them just enough of a lead to secure the seven - point win in front of their home crowd . While both teams are likely going to miss the playoffs , it was still a nice win for the Sixers , who notch just their fifteenth victory of the season . The Sixers did n't have the best night shooting the ball , but they still finished at 47 percent from the field and 28 percent from the three - point line as a team . Robert Covington led the way , scoring 24 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 6 - 12 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) , to go along with two assists and three steals . It was the most points he 's scored since the beginning of February , as he matched a season - high in hitting six three - point shots.Covington did receive some help though , as Nerlens Noel finished with 16 points ( 7 - 13 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) , 12 rebounds and a blocked shot . Noel remains inconsistent with his scoring , but continues to dominate the boards and has grabbed double - digit rebounds in seven of his last eight games . He 's averaging 9 points and 8 rebounds on the season . The Sixers also got some help from the bench from rookie Jerami Grant . Grant went 5 - for - 7 from the field to score 13 points , while also adding two steals and four blocked shots in 29 minutes . He had gone a combined 1 - for - 7 from the field over his last two games , so it was good to see him get things turned around . Ish Smith added 10 points ( 3 - 11 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , five rebounds and nine assists off the bench as well . Despite taking the loss , DeMarcus Cousins had himself a monster game . Cousins went 12 - for - 24 from the field and 15 - for - 20 from the free throw line to score a game - high of 39 points , while also grabbing 24 rebounds in the process . Cousins continues to play well of late , as this was his fifth straight double - double .

The bruised , weary , and depleted Heat are running out of able bodies , and it showed in their play on Wednesday . Fresh off a six - game road swing through the Western Conference and a subsequent 91 - 79 loss to the Bucks at American Airlines Arena in South Florida on Tuesday , Miami hit the road again shortly after the conclusion of that contest . Already down their top two point guards , the Heat then found out shortly before the game that Dwyane Wade would give his ailing shoulders a rest against the Wizards , leaving Gerald Green , who 'd been battling some knee tendinitis himself , in a starting role . Then , midway through the second quarter , injury befell one of the few healthy starters left , as Hassan Whiteside went out with a strained oblique and was unable to return . All of the personnel changes led to some predictably sluggish and sloppy play , with Miami turning the ball over 21 times , leading to 27 points for the home team . The visitors were spearheaded by the most talented healthy body remaining , Chris Bosh . The forward managed 18 points , four rebounds , two assists and a steal . Luol Deng , the other front - line player not watching from the bench , was next in line with 16 points , eight rebounds , an assist and a block . Tyler Johnson , filling in once again for both Goran Dragic ( calf ) and Beno Udrih ( neck ) , bounced back from an abysmal outing versus the Bucks by totaling 14 points , five assists and two rebounds . Veteran Amar'e Stoudemire paced the Heat bench with a season - high 11 points . The Heat fell to 23 - 20 - - their sixth loss in the last seven games - - and remain in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They now head to Toronto for a matchup with the Raptors on Friday . Washington was led by a pair of 18 - point efforts from a familiar duo , John Wall and Bradley Beal . Wall did his damage as a starter over 32 minutes , and added 10 assists and four rebounds . Beal , in turn , turned in his effort in a reserve role over 25 minutes . He supplemented his scoring with three rebounds , two assists and a steal . Nene Hilario was next in line with an outstanding all - around performance , posting 16 points , six rebounds , an assist and five steals . Marcin Gortat took advantage of an extended stretch without Whiteside in front of him , putting together his fifth straight double - double with 15 points , 12 rebounds , two assists and a pair of blocks . Garrett Temple was productive as well , amassing 11 points , three assists , two rebounds and a steal . The Wizards improved to 20 - 21 and are now in a third - place tie with the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They remain home and await the Utah Jazz for a Saturday evening showdown .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

If the Celtics could get balanced efforts like these across their roster on a consistent basis , they would likely sport an even better record . Virtually every Boston player seemed to be hitting on all cylinders Friday , with seven managing double - digit scoring . They also received a double - double and a triple - double from Jared Sullinger and Marcus Smart , respectively , and outperformed the visitors in every major offensive and defensive category . The Celtics cruised to a 68 - 47 halftime lead , before finishing things out in the second half for their largest margin of victory since Dec. 22 against the Timberwolves . The Suns ' leading scorer came from the bench , as Mirza Teletovic continued his solid stretch of offensive play . The power forward posted 22 points , two rebounds and an assist over 21 minutes , his seventh consecutive double - digit scoring performance . Brandon Knight was tops among the starters , collecting 16 points , four assists , two steals and a block . T.J. Warren and Sonny Weems were two more solid contributors off the bench , amassing 13 and 10 points , respectively . The latter was particularly proficient across the stat sheet , adding six rebounds , five assists and a pair of steals . Markieff Morris , back in the starting lineup , tallied nine points , nine rebounds , four assists and a steal . The Suns fell to 13 - 28 and remain in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They now head to Minnesota to face off with the Timberwolves on Sunday . Like the visitors , a reserve , Kelly Olynyk , spearheaded the Celtics ' attack , pouring in 21 points and hauling in nine rebounds . He added an assist , three steals and a block . Isaiah Thomas was productive against his former team , tallying 19 points , five assists and two rebounds . Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder posted a pair of 17 - point efforts , with the former supplementing his scoring with seven rebounds , three assists and a pair of steals , and the latter hauling in six boards , five assists , three steals and a pair of blocks . Sullinger 's contributions consisted of 11 points , 10 rebounds and a pair of assists . Amir Johnson rounded out the starters ' productive evening with 13 points , five rebounds , two assists and a steal , while Smart stuffed the stat sheet by registering 10 points , 11 rebounds , 11 assists , a pair of steals and a pair of blocks in a stellar performance off the bench .

Mike Scott was also huge for the Hawks off the bench , scoring 20 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) and grabbing eight rebounds in 31 minutes .

Kenneth Faried did make his return after a three - game absence due to an ankle injury , but played just 14 minutes . Denver has now scored 161 points over their last two games and this is obviously not the potent up - tempo Denver offense of the past . They 'll look to get out of this six - game skid when they play another struggling team in the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday . Dallas played some fantastic defense en route to an impressive win on Saturday . The surprise start for Dallas has to be credited to Zaza Pachulia , who put in yet another great game . Pachulia collected 16 points , 12 rebounds and three steals to pick up his 10th double - double of the season . Deron Williams also had a nice game , as he amassed 22 points , four assists and four rebounds in the win . The Mavericks had 13 steals in the game and they forced the Nuggets into bad shots time after time . This is n't the prettiest team in the NBA , but they 're certainly dangerous and a threat in the West . Dallas will play the Sacramento Kings on Monday in their next scheduled game .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

The Pistons had a strong first half , out - scoring the Knicks 57 - 38 . With the strong start , they were able to coast through the second half and secure a 16 - point victory . The Pistons shot well in this one , going 50 percent from the field and 39 percent from the three - point line , while the Knicks went only 35 percent from the field and 42 percent from beyond the arc . Brandon Jennings had himself a game Friday . In only 24 minutes , Jennings went 11 - for - 17 from the floor and 4 - for - 8 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 29 points . It was a nice bounce back game for him after scoring only five points against the Orlando Magic on Tuesday . Jodie Meeks provided a big contribution off the bench . He scored 15 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt ) in 25 minutes . Meeks is coming off a 34 - point outing on Tuesday , so he continued to ride his hot hand and had another good showing Friday . While he did n't have much of an offensive impact , Andre Drummond was a monster on the boards . He finished with 20 rebounds , marking the second game in a row and fifth time this season recording at least 20 rebounds . He 's now averaging 13 rebounds per game on the season . Greg Monroe had 12 points and 10 rebounds of his own , giving him his tenth double - double of the season . Without Carmelo Anthony , Amare Stoudemire or Samuel Dalembert in the lineup , the Knicks were really thin . J.R. Smith was about the only bright spot for them , as he went 8 - for - 20 from the field and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score 22 points in 36 minutes . He was in the starting lineup for only the fifth time this season , and he capitalized on his opportunity . The only other Knick to reach double figures was Cole Aldrich . He started at center and finished with 11 points and 14 rebounds . It marked his third double - double of the season . With all the injuries and only two players reaching double - digit points , the Knicks just did n't have the offensive fire power to stay within reach . The Pistons ' next game will be at home against the Sacramento Kings on Sunday , while the Knicks will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

The Timberwolves ( 28 - 38 ) did n't waste any time opening up Monday 's contest , as they ended the first quarter with an 18 - point lead and never let the Wizards ( 41 - 25 ) within one possession , as their smallest lead from that point was five points . Karl-Anthony Towns had his way in the outing , scoring a game - high 39 points on 17 - of - 26 shooting and grabbing 13 rebounds . Those offensive opportunities for Towns came in large part to the play of Ricky Rubio , who scored 22 points and recorded 19 assists in Monday 's matchup . It was a hot shooting night for the team overall , as Minnesota shot 52 percent from the field and a scorching 48 percent from behind the arc . As for Washington , the loss ended a five - game winning streak , but the team has still won seven of its last nine games . They were led , once again , by their backcourt of John Wall and Bradley Beal . Wall finished with a game - high 27 points , while scored 20 points of his own .

Golden State ( 35 - 6 ) avenged its loss on Christmas day with a crushing victory over the Cavaliers on Monday . The Warriors came out strong from the start , establishing a double - digit lead in the first quarter and a 20 - point lead by midway through the second . Everything seemed to be firing for Golden State on both sides of the ball , as the Warriors shot a ridiculous 50 percent from the floor while draining 15 three - pointers . Despite historic matchup troubles with Cleveland , reigning MVP Steph Curry delivered on Monday , scoring 20 points to go with 11 assists and four steals . Curry had recorded a double - double by the end of the Warriors ' electrifying first half , playing a major part of the 29 - point lead the team was able to establish . Overall , Golden State absolutely demolished Cleveland in every aspect , including holding a 58 - 35 rebounding advantage . Cleveland ( 29 - 11 ) had won four straight against the Warriors prior to Monday 's game . The Cavaliers played arguably their worst game of the season , shooting just 35 percent from the field and recording only 11 assists . While pregame statements from team leader LeBron James indicated that Cleveland had undergone no special preparation for Monday 's game , the drubbing still came as a surprise to most . James led the team with 20 points but shot just 6 - of - 18 and committed an uncharacteristic six turnovers . Kyrie Irving was just 6 - of - 19 , while Kevin Love was held to only three points . The Warriors will host the Thunder on Wednesday , while Cleveland will host the Suns on Thursday .The Warriors ran away with Monday 's hotly - anticipated matchup against the Cavaliers , winning by 35 points . Reigning MVP Steph Curry scored 20 points to go with 11 assists in four steals in a statement game against a team that normally is able to contain him . All-Star guard Klay Thompson led the team with 26 points . Draymond Green recorded a triple - double with 11 points , 13 rebounds , and 11 assists to go with five blocks . Former MVP Kevin Durant added another 21 points and three blocks . All of that amounted to an absurd night for the Warriors , who finished shooting over 50 percent with 15 three - pointers , a 58 - 35 rebounding advantage , and 37 assists . It was very much so the opposite night for Cleveland , as the team 's stars all struggled . LeBron James scored a team - high 20 but shot just 6 - of - 18 . Kevin Love was held to three points , and Kyrie Irving shot only 6 - of - 19 . The team finished at just 35 percent from the field with only 11 assists .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

The Grizzlies were able to dominate right from the start in this one , out - scoring the Knicks 47 - 36 in the first half alone . They were then able to coast to a 22 - point victory in the second half , giving the home fans a show . The Grizzlies were the superior shooters in this one , going 52 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three - point line , while the Knicks went just 43 percent from the floor and 31 percent from beyond the arc . With Zach Randolph still sidelined , both Mike Conley and Marc Gasol continued to make up for the bulk of his production . Conley had a very effective shooting night , going 9 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score 22 points . He did a little bit of everything in this game , nearing a triple - double with seven rebounds and seven assists as well . Conley struggled to only eight points on Saturday , so it was a nice bounce back game for him . Gasol on the other hand posted 14 points ( 5 - 12 FG , 4 - 5 FT ) , eight rebounds and two blocks . He did n't near his season average of 20 points per game , but he was still effective enough to help secure the victory . Tony Allen had 14 points ( 6 - 8 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) of his own . More importantly though , Allen had a huge defensive effort in this one , posting a season - high of seven steals . The only other player to reach double figures was Courtney Lee , who had 11 points in 26 minutes . The Knicks were still without Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire , which continued to limit their offensive abilities . Quincy Acy led the team in a surprise performance off the bench . He went 7 - for - 8 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score 19 points . He had only reached double figures three other times this season , making it even more impressive for the young forward . He also got it done on the boards though , posting a season - high of 14 rebounds . It marked his first double - double of the year . Jose Calderon was one of the only other players to give Acy any help . Calderon was very efficient with his shot , going 5 - for - 7 from the floor and 3 - for - 3 from beyond the arc to score 13 points , while adding six assists . Tim Hardaway Jr seemingly struggled to get in a groove and finished with 12 points ( 4 - 14 FG , 2 - 8 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) in 33 minutes . The Grizzlies ' next game will be on the road against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday , while the Knicks will travel to Washington to play the Wizards on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",

Golden State has been the best team in the NBA this season , but this was the first time they played without playmaker Draymond Green . The defense is what suffered most without Green , as they allowed 112 points in the loss .

The Hornets led the whole way in this one , after a very strong , 69 - 53 first half . The Pistons fought back , bringing it to a five - point game late in the third , but could never gain the lead . With this win the Hornets have now won six in a row for the first time in six seasons , and have also won seven in a row at home , where their record is now a solid 24 - 9 . The Pistons came into this one winners of their last two games but had their win streak cut short , and their grip on eighth in the East loosened , as they came in only half a game ahead of Chicago . Kemba Walker was relatively quiet as he failed to record 30 points , a feat which he accomplished in his four previous games . Instead , Walker finished with 16 points ( 3 - 11 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 9 - 9 FT ) , eight assists , one rebound and one steal , in 32 minutes . Six other players scored in double digits for the Hornets , more than compensating for Walker 's quiet game . Marvin Williams was the high - point man for Charlotte , as he finished with 22 points ( 7 - 12 FG , 5 - 8 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , along with six rebounds , in 25 minutes . Nicolas Batum logged a double - double as he added 17 points and 11 assists , along with five rebounds and two steals , in 37 minutes . The Hornets did a good job at the foul line , hitting 24 - 29 free throws and shot a solid 51 percent from the field and 40 percent from deep . Reggie Jackson had a strong game for Detroit , finishing with 20 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 2 - 9 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , 10 assists and two rebounds , in 31 minutes . Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 24 points ( 9 - 16 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , in 38 minutes , while Tobias Harris chipped in 20 points ( 6 - 14 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 6 - 6 FT ) , five rebounds , three steals and one assist , in 34 minutes . Stanley Johnson made his return to the lineup after being out with a shoulder injury that he suffered on February 22nd . Johnson logged nine minutes , during which he contributed three points ( 1 - 1 3Pt ) . Next , the Pistons head straight to Philly to play the third game of their current four - game road trip , on Saturday . The Hornets will look to extend their overall win streak and also their home win streak as they host the Rockets on Saturday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

The already - decimated Suns entered Tuesday 's tough road tilt in an even further weakened state , as Brandon Knight was ruled out earlier in the day with an illness . That left Phoenix with a very young starting backcourt of Archie Goodwin and Devin Booker , and both acquitted themselves the best of all five starters . Meanwhile , even a 30 - minute power outage failed to derail a sharpshooting Pacers squad , who managed to drain 52 percent of their attempts from the field , and post a 42 percent tally from three - point range . Indiana was equally proficient on the defensive end , taking the ball from the outmanned visitors 19 times and converting those turnovers into 27 points . Goodwin and Booker contributed 12 and 19 - point efforts , respectively , as the only Suns starters with double - digit scoring . Both players also pitched in with a pair of rebounds and assists apiece . P.J . Tucker did haul in a solid 10 rebounds , but only was able to pitch in a modest five points and hand out five assists . The rest of the notable offensive contributions came from the Phoenix bench , with Mirza Teletovic leading the charge with 19 points , five rebounds and a pair of assists . Markieff Morris contributed 16 points , nine rebounds , an assist and a steal over 27 minutes , his best performance by far since a season - high 28 - point outburst against the Spurs on Nov. 23 . T.J. Warren was the third reserve with double - digit scoring , amassing 10 points , four rebounds , four assists and a steal . The Suns fell to 13 - 27 and remain in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They now head to Boston for a Friday night showdown versus the Celtics . Indiana enjoyed solid nights from all members of their starting five , led by Paul George 's 21 points , seven rebounds , an assist , two steals and two blocks . George Hill was a close runner - up , managing 20 points , five assists and three rebounds . His backcourt mate Monta Ellis poured in 14 points , dished out seven assists and tallied four steals , as he and Hill exploited the inexperience of the Suns ' backcourt for the evening . Ian Mahinmi continued his solid play with 10 points five rebounds , two assists and two steals , while Lavoy Allen rounded things out for the first unit with a productive eight points and seven boards . C.J . Miles came off the bench to play 31 minutes and amass an impressive 19 points , eight rebounds , two assists , a steal and a block . The Pacers improved to 22 - 16 and moved into sole possession of third place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They head to Boston to take on the Celtics on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

Midway through the third quarter , it looked like the Warriors were going to run away with the game , maintaining a double - digit lead through the first six or so minutes . However , the Clippers were able to make a run late in the quarter to take a one - point lead into final period . From there , it was the Stephen Curry show . While Los Angeles managed to keep it close through the final 12 minutes , they simply had no answer for last year 's MVP . Curry scored 13 points in the fourth quarter and finished with 31 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 7 - 11 3Pt ) for the game in 33 minutes . Harrison Barnes also came up big in the fourth quarter , scoring 10 straight points at one point and finishing with a team - high nine rebounds in 36 minutes . Klay Thompson 's clutch free throws put the game out of reach , and his block on Jamal Crawford in the closing seconds sealed the deal . He finished with 16 points in 32 minutes . For the Clippers , Chris Paul and Blake Griffin did everything they could to keep their team in the game , but in the end , it just was n't enough . Griffin stuffed the stat sheet , scoring 23 points , grabbing 10 rebounds and dishing out six assists in 38 minutes , while Paul managed a team - high 24 points and nine assists in 29 minutes . DeAndre Jordan recorded a double - double of 11 points and 13 rebounds . Up next , the Warriors will stay at home to play the Nuggets on Thursday , while the Clippers will head home Friday to face the Rockets .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

Len did his damage off the bench , while starting center Miles Plumlee played just 15 minutes , a development that does n't mean much in the course of one game , but after the Suns invested a fifth - overall pick in the 2013 NBA Draft on Len , his development is something they 're going to be keen to push , and that may come at the expense of Plumlee at some point .

After showing dominant offensive flow on Thursday in a rout of the Thunder , the Warriors shot just 5 - for - 32 from three in Friday 's contest . This included 0 - for - 10 for Steph Curry , whose NBA-record streak of 157 games with a three - point make finally came to an end .

Despite both teams having already been eliminated from playoff contention , this still marked a hard fought game between these Western Conference rivals . The Kings came out as the superior shooters in this one , going 53 percent from the field and 38 percent from the three - point line , while the Timberwolves finished at 48 percent from the floor and just 32 percent from deep . Also helping push the Kings to a win was their rebounding , as they finished with a 49 - 36 advantage . With DeMarcus Cousins sidelined because of a foot injury , it was Rudy Gay and Omri Casspi who really stepped up and had huge games . Gay finished with 33 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 13 - 15 FT ) , seven rebounds and five assists , while Casspi posted 31 points ( 12 - 20 FG , 4 - 6 3Pt , 3 - 5 FT ) and five rebounds . Casspi had far - and - away his best performance of the season , as he 's really picked it up lately . Over his last four games , he 's averaging 20 points , while shooting an impressive 57 percent from the field . Gay , on the other hand , is on fire as well , combining to go 19 - of - 35 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from deep for 57 points over his last two outings . He 's now pushed his season averages to 21 points and 6 rebounds per game on the season . Coming off the bench , Derrick Williams had a strong showing as well . He went 8 - for - 12 from the field to score 18 points , while adding eight rebounds over 31 minutes as well . The 18 points matched a season - high for the forward , as it was one of his better outings of the year . Despite being unable to limit the Kings ' offense , the Timberwolves nearly pulled off the victory due to some strong offensive performances of their own . Kevin Martin had the most impressive line , finishing with 37 points ( 13 - 31 FG , 3 - 11 3Pt , 8 - 11 FT ) and eight assists . It was a season - high in field goal attempts for the guard , who had a slightly better performance than he did on Friday , where he went just 3 - of - 12 from the field . He 's now averaging 20 points on the season and will continue to get off a ton of shots due to the vast amount of injuries the Timberwolves are dealing with . Rookie Andrew Wiggins had a big game as well though , recording 26 points ( 11 - 20 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) and eight rebounds .

In 40 minutes , he finished with 21 points ( 9 - 18 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) and 11 assists , marking just the second double - double of his career .

New Orleans has been plagued by injury all season , a trend that continued in Dallas as small forward Tyreke Evans ( knee ) sat out with tendinitis in his right knee . Despite Evans 's absence , the team was able to walk away with a much - needed win . Fourth-year superstar Anthony Davis was dominant , pouring in 31 points and pulling down 14 rebounds for the double - double . Davis is averaging 23 points and 11 rebounds per game , and is second in the league in double - doubles to Detroit 's Andre Drummond . Unlike New Orleans , Dallas has looked strong through the first third of the season . The team handed Golden State their second loss of the season on Wednesday , and stands at second place in the Southwest division . Aging superstar Dirk Nowitzki lit up New Orleans for 24 points , but his effort was not enough to top the young and up - tempo Pelicans . Dallas will play again on Tuesday , taking on the Sacramento Kings . New Orleans , meanwhile , will not play again until they see the Mavericks at home on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

This was the Sixers best chance at a win all season , but they could n't quite hold off the Heat . Miami ended the game on a 20 - 4 run and held the Sixers to one basket over the final seven - plus minutes . Not to mention , that one basket was a meaningless one with just seconds left in the game . The Heat held the Sixers to 38 percent shooting and blocked 14 shots in the win . Philadelphia 's bench was a bright spot though , as they outscored Miami 's bench 47 to 26 . This was a rough loss in a disastrous season for Philadelphia . They had a big lead early , but simply could n't hold on . They did get two great bench performances , as Robert Covington dropped 21 points while Isiah Caanan dropped 22 points . Philadelphia 's best player on this night was rookie Jahlil Okafor , who tallied 16 points , 11 rebounds and three steals en route to a double - double . The rookie now leads the team in scoring and is second on the team in rebounding . They might have their best chance at a win when they take on the equally - young Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday . The Heat looked horrible in the first half , but leaned on their stifling defense to pull out a big win . Miami got an outstanding performance from Dwyane Wade , who tallied 27 points , seven rebounds , four assists and three steals in the victory . Hassan Whiteside also had a great game , as he collected 13 points , nine rebounds and eight blocks in the win . Those eight blocks add to his already league - leading total and he 's truly playing at a different level this season than years past . This is one of the best defenses in the NBA right now and they showed why on Saturday .

It was a big night for two Blazers in particular , as center Jusuf Nurkic and guard C.J . McCollum combined for 72 points for Portland ( 36 - 38 ) . Nurkic contributed a career - high scoring output of 33 points to go along with a whopping 16 rebounds and three blocks . The output came against his former team , from whom he was traded at the deadline . Nurkic was absolutely deadly from the field , shooting 12 - of - 15 from the field and 9 - of - 11 at the free - throw line . McCollum , meanwhile , shot 15 - of - 24 for a game - high 39 points . The two were the centers of a red - hot Blazers offense , as the team shot over 49 percent from the field and reached the line 33 times on the night . Denver ( 35 - 39 ) , meanwhile , saw slightly more balanced production from their scorers . Six Nuggets scored in double figures , and their own young big man nearly recorded a triple - double . Sophomore center Nikola Jokic cleaned up , recording 17 points , eight rebounds , and eight assists . However , the team simply could not slow down the two hot scorers for Portland . Foul trouble proved problematic as well , as the Nuggets got to the line 20 times but gave up 33 free - throws to Portland . The game was hugely impactful on the playoff standings , as Portland was able to pass Denver for eighth in the conference thanks to the win . Portland will host Houston on Wednesday , while Denver will visit Charlotte on Thursday .It was a huge night for Portland 's young stars , and in particular , recently acquired big man Jusuf Nurkic .

Offense was n't the only thing Nurkic provided , though , as he pulled down a whopping 16 rebounds to go along with two steals and three blocks . The young center continues to grow in his new starting role with Portland . Nurkic was not even his team 's high scorer , however , as shooting guard C.J . McCollum exploded for 39 points . McCollum shot 15 - of - 24 from the field and splashed home three three - pointers on the night . In addition , McCollum had five rebounds , three assists , and went 6 - of - 6 at the free - throw line . For Denver , young big man Nikola Jokic made an impact with 17 points , eight rebounds , and eight assists . Veteran starter Jameer Nelson also contributed somewhat surprisingly with a team - high 23 points on the night .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

Kawhi Leonard returned to the active lineup for the Spurs after missing extended time with an eye infection . He started at small forward and played 24 minutes . With Tiago Splitter ( back/calf ) still sidelined , Austin Daye was given a spot start at power forward to matchup with the Suns ' small - ball power forward Markieff Morris .

Alex Len played a career - high 32 minutes and finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds to record the first double - double of his NBA career . Len did his damage off the bench , while starting center Miles Plumlee played just 15 minutes , a development that does n't mean much in the course of one game , but after the Suns invested a fifth - overall pick in the 2013 NBA Draft on Len , his development is something they 're going to be keen to push , and that may come at the expense of Plumlee at some point .

Horford led the way for the Hawks , posting 24 points ( 11 - 20 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt ) , seven rebounds and four assists in 33 minutes of play . Teague recorded a double - double in the winning effort of 15 points ( 4 - 11 FG , 7 - 11 FT ) , 12 assists , six rebounds and four steals in 33 minutes as well . DeMarre Carroll was the other Atlanta starter to score in double figures , finishing with 19 points ( 7 - 13 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt ) , nine rebounds and four assists in 37 minutes . Mike Scott was also huge for the Hawks off the bench , scoring 20 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) and grabbing eight rebounds in 31 minutes . Paul Millsap was out once again with a shoulder injury , while Mike Muscala got the start in his place , but he had just nine points ( 4 - 6 FG ) in 24 minutes . The win brings Atlanta just one game away from 60 wins on the year with just four games remaining in the regular season . They have already locked up the number one seed for the Eastern Conference playoffs . Brook Lopez , as he has grown a habit of doing , led the way for Brooklyn , scoring 26 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 10 - 10 FT ) and grabbing 10 rebounds in 39 minutes . Over his last two games now , Lopez has put up 58 points and 19 rebounds . Joe Johnson was not too far behind Lopez , scoring 21 points ( 9 - 15 FG , 3 - 9 3Pt ) and grabbing eight rebounds , but he missed the potential game - tying three at the end of regulation . Deron Williams also continues to play well , posting a double - double of 10 points and 13 assists , while Thaddeus Young also recorded a double - double of 15 points and 11 rebounds . Jarrett Jack ( 14 ) and Bojan Bogdanovic ( 12 ) round out the six Nets ' players who scored in double figures . The Nets were hot coming into Wednesday 's matchup as winners of seven of their last eight , and while they are still winners of seven of their last nine , both those losses came at the hands of the Hawks . Regardless , the Nets still find themselves in the playoffs and hold a one - game lead over the Pacers and Heat for the final spot in the East . Up next , the Hawks will head home Friday to take on the Hornets , while the Nets will stay home Friday and play the Wizards .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

Reigning MVP Steph Curry went 0 - for - 10 from beyond the arc , failing to hit a three - pointer for the first time in 157 games . As the NBA record fell , Curry 's backcourt partner Klay Thompson saw struggles of his own , going just 2 - of - 10 from downtown . On the whole , the Warriors went just 5 - of - 32 from beyond the arc , their lowest three - point output of the season . Rebounding proved to be another major factor in the game . Los Angeles forward Julius Randle pulled down a season - high 14 boards , helping to give the Lakers a 51 - 40 rebounding advantage . Sophomore Larry Nance Jr. also provided a force in the paint , contributing nine rebounds and 12 points on perfect shooting .The host Los Angeles Lakers handily defeated the Golden State Warriors on Friday , 117 - 97 . It was Lakers ( 3 - 3 ) coach Luke Walton 's first game against the Warriors since leaving the organization over the offseason . Walton coached the Warriors for the beginning of their historic 2015 - 16 regular season in place of an injured Steve Kerr , but later left to pursue the head coaching job in Los Angeles . Walton certainly got the best of his former team , as the Lakers were able to maintain their hefty halftime lead down the stretch . The team successfully capitalized on their size advantage , holding a 51 - 40 advantage in the rebounding column . Third-year forward Julius Randle led the team with 20 points and was a monster on the boards , pulling down 14 rebounds . The Lakers also saw success from the line , hitting over 90 percent of their free - throws . For the Warriors ( 4 - 2 ) , it was a tough night from beyond the arc . After showing dominant offensive flow on Thursday in a rout of the Thunder , the Warriors shot just 5 - for - 32 from three in Friday 's contest . This included 0 - for - 10 for Steph Curry , whose NBA-record streak of 157 games with a three - point make finally came to an end . The results were n't much better for Klay Thompson , who went just 2 - for - 10 . Kevin Durant , meanwhile , continued to perform with his new team , leading the game with 27 points . The Lakers will host the Suns on Sunday , while the Warriors will host the still - winless Pelicans on Monday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

However , the Clippers were able to make a run late in the quarter to take a one - point lead into final period . From there , it was the Stephen Curry show . While Los Angeles managed to keep it close through the final 12 minutes , they simply had no answer for last year 's MVP .

Harrison Barnes also came up big in the fourth quarter , scoring 10 straight points at one point and finishing with a team - high nine rebounds in 36 minutes . Klay Thompson 's clutch free throws put the game out of reach , and his block on Jamal Crawford in the closing seconds sealed the deal . He finished with 16 points in 32 minutes . For the Clippers , Chris Paul and Blake Griffin did everything they could to keep their team in the game , but in the end , it just was n't enough .

The Kings fell behind early in the game and allowed the Grizzlies to pile on a 20 - point lead . Cousins did most of his damage from the free throw line , and finished with 17 points and 14 rebounds before exiting the game .

Rajon Rondo fouled out of the game , which dealt a heavy blow to the Kings chances with their two superstars sidelined , but rounded out the box score with 15 points , eight assists and six rebounds . The Kings will host the MIlwaukee Bucks ( 20 - 29 ) on Monday . Memphis got off to a hot start behind Tony Allen and Jeff Green , who outpaced the Kings up and down the court throughout the first quarter . The Grizzlies started to break down defensively during the fourth quarter , and DeMarcus Cousins was simply bullying his way to the free throw line , but Courtney Lee was clutch from the charity stripe when Sacramento needed to foul . Jeff Green led all scorers with 29 points , two rebounds and two assists , while Tony Allen earned most of his 12 points early and added five rebounds . Marc Gasol led the front court and finished with six points and five rebounds on 7 - of - 14 shooting on 34 minutes .

The Grizzlies were able to dominate right from the start in this one , out - scoring the Knicks 47 - 36 in the first half alone . They were then able to coast to a 22 - point victory in the second half , giving the home fans a show . The Grizzlies were the superior shooters in this one , going 52 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three - point line , while the Knicks went just 43 percent from the floor and 31 percent from beyond the arc . With Zach Randolph still sidelined , both Mike Conley and Marc Gasol continued to make up for the bulk of his production . Conley had a very effective shooting night , going 9 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score 22 points . He did a little bit of everything in this game , nearing a triple - double with seven rebounds and seven assists as well . Conley struggled to only eight points on Saturday , so it was a nice bounce back game for him . Gasol on the other hand posted 14 points ( 5 - 12 FG , 4 - 5 FT ) , eight rebounds and two blocks . He did n't near his season average of 20 points per game , but he was still effective enough to help secure the victory . Tony Allen had 14 points ( 6 - 8 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) of his own . More importantly though , Allen had a huge defensive effort in this one , posting a season - high of seven steals . The only other player to reach double figures was Courtney Lee , who had 11 points in 26 minutes . The Knicks were still without Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire , which continued to limit their offensive abilities . Quincy Acy led the team in a surprise performance off the bench . He went 7 - for - 8 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score 19 points . He had only reached double figures three other times this season , making it even more impressive for the young forward . He also got it done on the boards though , posting a season - high of 14 rebounds . It marked his first double - double of the year . Jose Calderon was one of the only other players to give Acy any help . Calderon was very efficient with his shot , going 5 - for - 7 from the floor and 3 - for - 3 from beyond the arc to score 13 points , while adding six assists . Tim Hardaway Jr seemingly struggled to get in a groove and finished with 12 points ( 4 - 14 FG , 2 - 8 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) in 33 minutes .

After being out - scored by 20 points in the second quarter , the Sixers had themselves in a hole , as they were down 64 - 51 at the half . They came out with a big third quarter though , where they out - scored the Kings 37 - 18 to give them just enough of a lead to secure the seven - point win in front of their home crowd . While both teams are likely going to miss the playoffs , it was still a nice win for the Sixers , who notch just their fifteenth victory of the season . The Sixers did n't have the best night shooting the ball , but they still finished at 47 percent from the field and 28 percent from the three - point line as a team . Robert Covington led the way , scoring 24 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 6 - 12 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) , to go along with two assists and three steals . It was the most points he 's scored since the beginning of February , as he matched a season - high in hitting six three - point shots.Covington did receive some help though , as Nerlens Noel finished with 16 points ( 7 - 13 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) , 12 rebounds and a blocked shot . Noel remains inconsistent with his scoring , but continues to dominate the boards and has grabbed double - digit rebounds in seven of his last eight games . He 's averaging 9 points and 8 rebounds on the season . The Sixers also got some help from the bench from rookie Jerami Grant . Grant went 5 - for - 7 from the field to score 13 points , while also adding two steals and four blocked shots in 29 minutes . He had gone a combined 1 - for - 7 from the field over his last two games , so it was good to see him get things turned around . Ish Smith added 10 points ( 3 - 11 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , five rebounds and nine assists off the bench as well . Despite taking the loss , DeMarcus Cousins had himself a monster game . Cousins went 12 - for - 24 from the field and 15 - for - 20 from the free throw line to score a game - high of 39 points , while also grabbing 24 rebounds in the process . Cousins continues to play well of late , as this was his fifth straight double - double . Over that five - game stretch , he 's averaging 25 points and 16 rebounds , as he 's one of the hottest players in the league . Rudy Gay also did his best in keeping the Kings close . In 40 minutes on the court , Gay finished with 24 points ( 7 - 17 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 9 - 10 FT ) and four rebounds . Like Cousins , he 's played extremely well over his last five games , averaging 28 points during that span , while shooting over 40 percent in each of those matchups as well.The only other King in double figures was Derrick Williams , who came off the bench for 15 points ( 5 - 9 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and three rebounds in 31 minutes . The Sixers ' next game will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday , while the Kings will travel to Washington to play the Wizards on Saturday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

Meanwhile , the Knicks ( 18 - 24 ) replaced Courtney Lee with Ron Baker at the two - guard spot , and brought Mindaugas Kuzminskas into the starting five as well with Lance Thomas unavailable due to a broken orbital bone and possible concussion brought about by a Jonas Valanciunas elbow a day prior . Carmelo Anthony shifted to power forward in place of Kristaps Porzingis , who was once again absent due to his sore Achilles .

Dennis Schroder , who had endured a rough couple of games coming in to Monday , had given the Hawks what would be their final margin of victory with a 25 - foot three - pointer jumper with 22 seconds remaining .

The Timberwolves ( 28 - 38 ) did n't waste any time opening up Monday 's contest , as they ended the first quarter with an 18 - point lead and never let the Wizards ( 41 - 25 ) within one possession , as their smallest lead from that point was five points . Karl-Anthony Towns had his way in the outing , scoring a game - high 39 points on 17 - of - 26 shooting and grabbing 13 rebounds . Those offensive opportunities for Towns came in large part to the play of Ricky Rubio , who scored 22 points and recorded 19 assists in Monday 's matchup . It was a hot shooting night for the team overall , as Minnesota shot 52 percent from the field and a scorching 48 percent from behind the arc . As for Washington , the loss ended a five - game winning streak , but the team has still won seven of its last nine games . They were led , once again , by their backcourt of John Wall and Bradley Beal . Wall finished with a game - high 27 points , while scored 20 points of his own . The next highest scorer for the Wizards , however , was Bojan Bogdanovic , who shot just 3 - of - 11 from the field en route to scoring 12 points . It was a poor shooting night all around for Washington , as the team shot just 43 percent from the field and 27 percent from behind the arc . Up next , the Timberwolves will travel to Boston on Wednesday to take on the Celtics , while the Wizards will head home to play the Mavericks on Wednesday .Ricky Rubio had a masterful performance in Monday 's victory over the Wizards , as he scored 22 points and dished out 19 assists in 39 minutes , and the big numbers the Spaniard is producing have become a staple for him in the month of March . After Monday 's performance , Rubio is now averaging 16 points and 12 assists over six games in March . Most impressive , however , is that Rubio has shot well over 50 percent from the field in his last two games , and over the six games in March , the point guard is shooting 47 percent from the field and 38 percent from behind the arc - - both which would easily be monthly bests this season . At this , Rubio , who has been seen as a offensive liability when it comes to shooting the ball for most of his career , is becoming yet another option for this team .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

Golden State ( 35 - 6 ) avenged its loss on Christmas day with a crushing victory over the Cavaliers on Monday . The Warriors came out strong from the start , establishing a double - digit lead in the first quarter and a 20 - point lead by midway through the second . Everything seemed to be firing for Golden State on both sides of the ball , as the Warriors shot a ridiculous 50 percent from the floor while draining 15 three - pointers . Despite historic matchup troubles with Cleveland , reigning MVP Steph Curry delivered on Monday , scoring 20 points to go with 11 assists and four steals . Curry had recorded a double - double by the end of the Warriors ' electrifying first half , playing a major part of the 29 - point lead the team was able to establish . Overall , Golden State absolutely demolished Cleveland in every aspect , including holding a 58 - 35 rebounding advantage . Cleveland ( 29 - 11 ) had won four straight against the Warriors prior to Monday 's game . The Cavaliers played arguably their worst game of the season , shooting just 35 percent from the field and recording only 11 assists . While pregame statements from team leader LeBron James indicated that Cleveland had undergone no special preparation for Monday 's game , the drubbing still came as a surprise to most . James led the team with 20 points but shot just 6 - of - 18 and committed an uncharacteristic six turnovers . Kyrie Irving was just 6 - of - 19 , while Kevin Love was held to only three points . The Warriors will host the Thunder on Wednesday , while Cleveland will host the Suns on Thursday .The Warriors ran away with Monday 's hotly - anticipated matchup against the Cavaliers , winning by 35 points .

Former MVP Kevin Durant added another 21 points and three blocks . All of that amounted to an absurd night for the Warriors , who finished shooting over 50 percent with 15 three - pointers , a 58 - 35 rebounding advantage , and 37 assists . It was very much so the opposite night for Cleveland , as the team 's stars all struggled . LeBron James scored a team - high 20 but shot just 6 - of - 18 .

What was expected to be a low - scoring contest turned into a back - and - forth showdown between the teams ' two best offensive players . Kemba Walker was outstanding for Charlotte , amassing a career - high and franchise - record 52 points , while Utah 's Gordon Hayward responded with 36 points of his own . While the spotlight largely and rightfully shone on that pair of remarkable efforts , Trey Burke also put together a notable performance while pacing the Jazz 's bench , which included a 23 - foot three - point jumper with 13 seconds remaining in regulation that sent the game into its first extra period . Burke 's key basket culiminated a 31 - 22 run by Utah in the fourth quarter to erase what had been a 73 - 64 deficit entering the period . After Rudy Gobert 's dunk off a Hayward assist with seven seconds left in the first overtime tied things up at 108 , Walker drained four free throws in the final minute of the sixth quarter to put a cap on what was a record - setting afternoon and send the Hornets to the locker room as weary victors . Hayward added nine assists , five rebounds , a pair of steals and a block to his team - high scoring total to pace the Jazz . Burke 's memorable afternoon consisted of a season - high 25 points , along with three rebounds , two assists and a steal . Gobert put together a second straight impressive double - double , tallying 14 points , hauling in 14 boards , dishing out three assists , and recording a steal and two blocks . Trevor Booker also made a significant contribution off the bench with 12 points , eight rebounds , an assist , a steal and a block . Utah fell to 18 - 23 and remains in second place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They head to New York to take on the Knicks on Wednesday . Walker almost added a triple - double to his spectacular afternoon , supplementing his eye - popping scoring numbers with nine rebounds and eight assists . He also threw in a pair of thefts .

The Wizards came out and got a quick start in this one , out - scoring the Magic 24 - 16 right away in the first quarter . Along with the fast start , the Wizards also shot better than the Magic , going 43 percent from the field and 28 percent from the three - point line , while the Magic went 40 percent from the floor and a meager 18 percent from beyond the arc . To put the icing on the cake , the Wizards also secured a 53 - 33 rebounding advantage . The Wizards had a balanced attack against the Magic , with the bench adding some valuable contributions . Leading the team in points was Rasual Butler , who posted 15 points ( 4 - 14 FG , 3 - 9 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) and three rebounds in 27 minutes off the bench . It was his second straight 15 - point game in a row , as he 's been a big reason the Wizards have won each of their last two games . Marcin Gortat had a strong showing and finished with 14 points ( 5 - 6 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) and 14 rebounds . He was a force on the boards and was a big help in securing such an impressive advantage in the rebounding category . Coming just shy of a triple - double , John Wall recorded nine points ( 3 - 10 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) , 10 rebounds and 10 assists . It was the first time he failed to reach double figures in points since December fifth , although he made up for it with a new season - high in rebounds . Nene added 14 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) and three rebounds as well . Like the Wizards , the Magic 's highest scorer was off the bench Tuesday , as Evan Fournier finished as the team leader in points . He went 7 - for - 14 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 18 points , while also adding two assists in 33 minutes . He continues to provide the Magic solid guard depth off the bench , as he 's now pushed his season averages to 12 points and 2 assists per game . Nikola Vucevic came close to recording a double - double , finishing with 14 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) and eight rebounds . After posting fourteen games in a row with at least 16 points , he 's now posted less than that in two straight games , as his shot attempts were noticeably down during that stretch . Also reaching double - digit points was Victor Oladipo , who recorded 13 points ( 6 - 18 FG , 0 - 6 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) , four rebounds and five assists . Rookie Elfrid Payton contributed 11 points and a season - high of six steals , as he stepped it up defensively for the Magic . The Wizards ' next game will be on the road against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday , while the Magic will be at home against the New York Knicks on Wednesday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

The Pistons ( 35 - 41 ) came into Thursday 's game in desperate need of a win , and even though they drew the team with the worst record in the league , they likely knew they were in for a fight . The Nets ( 16 - 59 ) have given virtually any team put in front of them a difficult time , and Thursday 's game proved to be no exception . Brooklyn actually carried a 39 - 35 lead into halftime , but Detroit was able to mount a fourth - quarter rally to secure the win . Both teams shot poorly overall , which left plenty of rebounding opportunities . The Pistons won the battle on the glass by a 53 - 46 margin and also managed to limit the Nets to sub - 40 percent success rates from the field and three - point range , respectively . Sean Kilpatrick actually paced the Nets from the bench , tallying 15 points , two rebounds and one assist . Jeremy Lin provided 14 points , five rebounds , four assists and one steal .

The Timberwolves ( 21 - 35 ) managed to keep pace with the East-leading Cavaliers ( 38 - 16 ) for a majority of Tuesday 's contest , and they were well within striking distance down the final stretch of the game . That was until LeBron James hit a step back three - pointer with two minutes remaining to take his team 's lead from three points to six . At that point , Minnesota was finished . James finished with 25 points on an efficient 10 - of - 14 shooting from the field to go along with 14 assists and eight rebounds as the Cavaliers walked out of the Target Center with their second straight victory and their sixth win in their last seven games . Kyrie Irving added 25 points of his own , Channing Frye posted a double - double of 21 points and 10 rebounds as Kevin Love 's replacement and the newest Cavalier , Derrick Williams , came off the bench to score 13 points Tuesday . As for those Timberwolves , a brilliant performance from Andrew Wiggins ended up not being enough for a team that has lacked a strong supporting cast all season . After scoring 20 points in the third quarter , Wiggins finished the game with 41 points on 16 - of - 29 shooting from the field . Karl-Anthony Towns had yet another productive night as well , scoring 26 points and grabbing eight rebounds , but besides those two , Minnesota failed to get much else offensively from their team . Ricky Rubio did manage to dish out a game - high 16 assists and grab eight rebounds , but he was n't able to produce enough in the scoring column , ending with just five points on 2 - of - 8 shooting from the field . Up next , the Cavaliers will look to continue to build on their lead in the Eastern Conference on Wednesday against the Pacers , while the Timberwolves will travel to Denver on Wednesday to take on the Nuggets .This season , Ricky Rubio has proven to be a crucial member of Minnesota 's offense with no legitimate backup point guards and now without the services of Zach LaVine ( knee ) . However , while Rubio has been putting up big - time assist numbers as of late , he remains a liability scoring - wise . Tuesday 's performance was yet another example for the Spaniard , as he posted a game - high 16 assists , which was his highest total since he dished out 17 on Jan. 11 against the Rockets . And while Rubio did an adequate job of getting his teammates involved , he struggled to get himself involved , scoring just five points on 2 - of - 8 shooting from the field . This was n't an aberration for the point guard either , as it was the seventh time this season that Rubio was able to record double - digit assists but not reach double - digit points .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

The Pistons shot well in this one , going 50 percent from the field and 39 percent from the three - point line , while the Knicks went only 35 percent from the field and 42 percent from beyond the arc .

It was a nice bounce back game for him after scoring only five points against the Orlando Magic on Tuesday . Jodie Meeks provided a big contribution off the bench . He scored 15 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt ) in 25 minutes . Meeks is coming off a 34 - point outing on Tuesday , so he continued to ride his hot hand and had another good showing Friday . While he did n't have much of an offensive impact , Andre Drummond was a monster on the boards . He finished with 20 rebounds , marking the second game in a row and fifth time this season recording at least 20 rebounds . He 's now averaging 13 rebounds per game on the season . Greg Monroe had 12 points and 10 rebounds of his own , giving him his tenth double - double of the season .

Smith was about the only bright spot for them , as he went 8 - for - 20 from the field and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score 22 points in 36 minutes . He was in the starting lineup for only the fifth time this season , and he capitalized on his opportunity . The only other Knick to reach double figures was Cole Aldrich . He started at center and finished with 11 points and 14 rebounds . It marked his third double - double of the season . With all the injuries and only two players reaching double - digit points , the Knicks just did n't have the offensive fire power to stay within reach . The Pistons ' next game will be at home against the Sacramento Kings on Sunday , while the Knicks will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

The bruised , weary , and depleted Heat are running out of able bodies , and it showed in their play on Wednesday . Fresh off a six - game road swing through the Western Conference and a subsequent 91 - 79 loss to the Bucks at American Airlines Arena in South Florida on Tuesday , Miami hit the road again shortly after the conclusion of that contest . Already down their top two point guards , the Heat then found out shortly before the game that Dwyane Wade would give his ailing shoulders a rest against the Wizards , leaving Gerald Green , who 'd been battling some knee tendinitis himself , in a starting role . Then , midway through the second quarter , injury befell one of the few healthy starters left , as Hassan Whiteside went out with a strained oblique and was unable to return . All of the personnel changes led to some predictably sluggish and sloppy play , with Miami turning the ball over 21 times , leading to 27 points for the home team . The visitors were spearheaded by the most talented healthy body remaining , Chris Bosh . The forward managed 18 points , four rebounds , two assists and a steal . Luol Deng , the other front - line player not watching from the bench , was next in line with 16 points , eight rebounds , an assist and a block . Tyler Johnson , filling in once again for both Goran Dragic ( calf ) and Beno Udrih ( neck ) , bounced back from an abysmal outing versus the Bucks by totaling 14 points , five assists and two rebounds . Veteran Amar'e Stoudemire paced the Heat bench with a season - high 11 points . The Heat fell to 23 - 20 - - their sixth loss in the last seven games - - and remain in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They now head to Toronto for a matchup with the Raptors on Friday . Washington was led by a pair of 18 - point efforts from a familiar duo , John Wall and Bradley Beal . Wall did his damage as a starter over 32 minutes , and added 10 assists and four rebounds . Beal , in turn , turned in his effort in a reserve role over 25 minutes . He supplemented his scoring with three rebounds , two assists and a steal . Nene Hilario was next in line with an outstanding all - around performance , posting 16 points , six rebounds , an assist and five steals . Marcin Gortat took advantage of an extended stretch without Whiteside in front of him , putting together his fifth straight double - double with 15 points , 12 rebounds , two assists and a pair of blocks . Garrett Temple was productive as well , amassing 11 points , three assists , two rebounds and a steal . The Wizards improved to 20 - 21 and are now in a third - place tie with the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They remain home and await the Utah Jazz for a Saturday evening showdown .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

This is the fourth time that these teams have squared off with all four being close . In the most recent one , the Nuggets lost a heartbreaker in overtime , but prevailed here . What won it for Denver was their rebounding , as they grabbed 49 rebounds to the Warriors 39 . The Nuggets were also fantastic from the free - throw line , as they went 33 - for - 37 with some clutch throws down the stretch . Steph Curry went bananas in the fourth quarter to nearly cap off a big comeback , but they fell just short . Golden State has been the best team in the NBA this season , but this was the first time they played without playmaker Draymond Green . The defense is what suffered most without Green , as they allowed 112 points in the loss . Curry was in his MVP form , as he scored 20 fourth quarter points en route to a 38 point - nine assist line . Harrison Barnes had his best game since returning from injury , as he finished with 18 points off the bench . Andrew Bogut has been struggling all season , but he played well here , finishing with 15 points , seven rebounds , and three blocks in the loss . Luckily for Golden State , they get a date against the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday in their next game . Denver has been struggling at home all season , but easily got their biggest win of the year here . It was an all - around team effort , as four different players scored at least 18 points . Those players included Danilo Gallinari , Will Barton , Gary Harris and Darrell Arthur . Gallinari has been averaging over 25 points a game since his return from injury and he was huge here , as he finished the game with 28 points in the win . Denver has now played the Warriors four times this season and all four games came down to the fourth quarter . It 's a strange occurrence , but it shows the talent that this young teams has . The Nuggets will host the Miami Heat on Friday in their next scheduled game .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

An exhausted Chicago squad could only manage 31 total points in the second half , and two double - digit scorers over the entire game .

The Mavericks and Nuggets were in a tightly - contested battle at halftime , but something drastic happened to alter the result . The Nuggets did n't show up in the third quarter and they put up some mind boggling stats . Denver started the quarter going 0 - for - 14 with six turnovers and failed to score in the first nine minutes . That started a 160 run for Dallas and they never looked back after that . The turnovers were a problem as well , as Dallas won that battle 20 - 13 . A five - point third quarter proved to be the difference in a frustrating loss for the Nuggets . Scoring 29 points in the second half simply wo n't get it done in the NBA and that 's just what the Nuggets did . The team was led by Darrell Arthur , who tallied 16 points , five rebounds , two steals and two blocks in the defeat . Kenneth Faried did make his return after a three - game absence due to an ankle injury , but played just 14 minutes . Denver has now scored 161 points over their last two games and this is obviously not the potent up - tempo Denver offense of the past . They 'll look to get out of this six - game skid when they play another struggling team in the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday . Dallas played some fantastic defense en route to an impressive win on Saturday . The surprise start for Dallas has to be credited to Zaza Pachulia , who put in yet another great game . Pachulia collected 16 points , 12 rebounds and three steals to pick up his 10th double - double of the season . Deron Williams also had a nice game , as he amassed 22 points , four assists and four rebounds in the win . The Mavericks had 13 steals in the game and they forced the Nuggets into bad shots time after time . This is n't the prettiest team in the NBA , but they 're certainly dangerous and a threat in the West . Dallas will play the Sacramento Kings on Monday in their next scheduled game .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

The already - decimated Suns entered Tuesday 's tough road tilt in an even further weakened state , as Brandon Knight was ruled out earlier in the day with an illness . That left Phoenix with a very young starting backcourt of Archie Goodwin and Devin Booker , and both acquitted themselves the best of all five starters . Meanwhile , even a 30 - minute power outage failed to derail a sharpshooting Pacers squad , who managed to drain 52 percent of their attempts from the field , and post a 42 percent tally from three - point range . Indiana was equally proficient on the defensive end , taking the ball from the outmanned visitors 19 times and converting those turnovers into 27 points . Goodwin and Booker contributed 12 and 19 - point efforts , respectively , as the only Suns starters with double - digit scoring . Both players also pitched in with a pair of rebounds and assists apiece . P.J . Tucker did haul in a solid 10 rebounds , but only was able to pitch in a modest five points and hand out five assists . The rest of the notable offensive contributions came from the Phoenix bench , with Mirza Teletovic leading the charge with 19 points , five rebounds and a pair of assists . Markieff Morris contributed 16 points , nine rebounds , an assist and a steal over 27 minutes , his best performance by far since a season - high 28 - point outburst against the Spurs on Nov. 23 . T.J. Warren was the third reserve with double - digit scoring , amassing 10 points , four rebounds , four assists and a steal . The Suns fell to 13 - 27 and remain in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They now head to Boston for a Friday night showdown versus the Celtics . Indiana enjoyed solid nights from all members of their starting five , led by Paul George 's 21 points , seven rebounds , an assist , two steals and two blocks . George Hill was a close runner - up , managing 20 points , five assists and three rebounds . His backcourt mate Monta Ellis poured in 14 points , dished out seven assists and tallied four steals , as he and Hill exploited the inexperience of the Suns ' backcourt for the evening . Ian Mahinmi continued his solid play with 10 points five rebounds , two assists and two steals , while Lavoy Allen rounded things out for the first unit with a productive eight points and seven boards . C.J . Miles came off the bench to play 31 minutes and amass an impressive 19 points , eight rebounds , two assists , a steal and a block . The Pacers improved to 22 - 16 and moved into sole possession of third place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division .

      "In the game on February 15, 2017, the Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Brooklyn Nets 129-125 at Barclays Center. The performance of the Bucks was marked by several pivotal moments that defined their victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Strong Offensive Output**: The Bucks demonstrated an excellent offensive display, shooting 57% from the field and 47% from three-point range. This efficiency allowed them to establish a substantial lead during the game, specifically by outscoring the Nets in the first half.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Key Contributions**: Giannis Antetokounmpo was instrumental, scoring 33 points along with nine rebounds and four steals. His ability to score efficiently and make defensive plays was significant in maintaining the Bucks' lead. Additionally, Greg Monroe provided a strong performance off the bench with 25 points and 8 rebounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Third Quarter Surge**: The pivotal moment came in the third quarter when the Bucks outscored the Nets by 11 points. This momentum shift allowed them to build a buffer that they would rely on during the final stretch of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clutch Free Throws and Defensive Plays**: The Bucks maintained their lead into the fourth quarter, where a series of free throws in the critical moments preserved their advantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Nets' Late Rally**: Although the Nets managed to cut the lead down and made the game competitive late, the Bucks’ initial lead and their ability to execute in crucial moments helped them stay ahead as the clock wound down.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Defensive Presence**: Milwaukee’s defense played a role in minimizing the influence of the Nets' key players while forcing turnovers and capitalizing on them, thus contributing to their overall scoring advantage.\n",
