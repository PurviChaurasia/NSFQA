8,February,2017,Wednesday,2016,FedExForum,Memphis,Tennessee,16000,17800,2733,"Suns point guard Eric Bledsoe is having by far the most productive season of his career so far , making this cold stretch he has been on over his last four games even more uncharacteristic . His performance Wednesday night was the worst of them all , with Bledsoe shooting just 3 - of - 15 while still managing to come up with 16 points thanks to some good free throw shooting . But this is starting to become a trend , as Bledsoe has shot 13 - of - 47 ( 28 percent ) from the field over his last four contests . Despite those horrific shooting numbers , Bledsoe has still managed to average 16 points per game over that stretch , but that is only because of his ability to get to the line .

As a team , Memphis managed to do heavy damage from long range , shooting a hot 14 - of - 24 ( 58 percent ) from behind the arc . The victory did come , however , with a bit of recklessness , as the Grizzlies recorded 22 total turnovers on just 24 assists . For the Suns ( 16 - 37 ) , their struggles continued , as Wednesday 's loss was their third in a row and eighth in the last nine games . And this one was one of the more forgetful outings , as the team shot just 33 percent from the field and 22 percent from behind the arc . They also managed to play rather recklessly , recording just 13 assists to their 15 total turnovers . Devin Booker ended up leading the way with a team - high 20 points , while Eric Bledsoe had a disastrous night shooting from the field , going just 3 - of - 15 en route to scoring 16 points .

The Kings ( 10 - 17 ) checked in to the contest short - handed , as both Rudy Gay ( hip ) and Omri Casspi ( illness ) were sidelined . That put the onus on DeMarcus Cousins even more than usual , and he did respond with a game - high 33 points , along with six rebounds and a block .

Meanwhile , the Mavs ( 7 - 20 ) saw six players hit double digits in the scoring column , while shooting a solid 45 percent from the field as a team . Kosta Koufos was the next most productive starter for the Kings , albeit a distant second to Cousins ' standout effort . Koufos posted six points , nine rebounds and a pair of steals . Garrett Temple and Ben McLemore posted a pair of five - point efforts , and Darren Collison turned in a disappointing two points , three assists and a rebound on just 1 - of - 8 shooting over 25 minutes .

Since returning , Beal has been averaging 28 points while shooting 50 percent from the field overall . And while those numbers jump off the page , what may jump even higher off the page is the number of minutes he has been playing . Beal , who already has a rich injury history in this young season , has played at least 38 minutes in his last six games with the 42 he played against Oklahoma City being the highest he 's played all season .
