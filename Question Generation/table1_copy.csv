He finished this game with 29 points , 17 rebounds and 11 assists en route to his 15th triple - double of the season .

Anthony finished with 21 points , six rebounds and seven assists on 7 - of - 19 shooting in just under 35 minutes , but it was not the scoring output they needed to break New York out of a slump . Kristaps Porzingis struggled early , only completing two of his first nine attempts from the floor , and was a major part of Denver storming out to an eleven point lead at the end of the first quarter . Porzingis did finish strong on the shooting end to salvage what was close to his worst shooting performance of the season , as the lanky rookie scored 21 points on 10 - of - 23 shooting , to go along with 13 rebounds , two assists and two blocks . Langston Galloway went back to his bench role as Derek Fisher did not go with a three guard lineup with Anthony returning to the small forward slot , but Galloway still saw 20 minutes of game time and finished with six points , as both buckets came from behind the arc . The Knicks will look to end their skid when they host the Washington Wizards ( 22 - 27 ) on Tuesday . The Nuggets did not have a player score more than 20 points in the game , but their unselfish style of play lent way to an early first half lead and strong fourth quarter finish . Denver 's only bad quarter came in the third quarter , where some tough shots just did not fall . Danilo Gallinari and Will Barton led the Nuggets with 19 points each , but rookie point guard Emmanuel Mudiay has been playing very well since returning from injury and it is beginning to have a great impact on the team . Mudiay is coming off a 22 point performance against the Bulls on Friday , and added 19 points on Friday , to go along with four rebounds and nine assists . The young Nuggets squad started another rookie alongside Mudiay , center Nikola Jokic , who scored 13 points and grabbed six rebounds in 18 minutes . Denver was able to coast to a win in the waning minutes of the fourth quarter , doing most of their damage from the free throw line to consistently keep the Knicks out of reach . The Nuggets will play a back - to - back and hop from Manhattan to Brooklyn to take on the Brooklyn Nets ( 13 - 39 ) on Monday ."

The rookie has played few minutes thus far this season , but has shown signs of high potential , as evidenced by his strong showing on Tuesday . 30 points from Carmelo Anthony was not enough for the Knicks to secure a win , as no other starter reached double digits in scoring . Melo hit all of his 11 free - throws while going 9 - for - 18 from the floor , putting the team on his shoulders in an otherwise sloppy performance by the struggling Knicks .

Oladipo was stellar again Friday , sharing the team lead with 20 points and adding nine rebounds , a pair of assists , three steals and a block . Considering his recent performances , the Magic will certainly have a good problem on their hands upon Payton 's return to health from his ankle injury , as they 'll be faced with trying to get a talented backcourt trio that also includes Evan Fournier sufficient playing time . Nikola Vucevic was Oladipo 's co - leading scorer on the night with a 20 - point , 10 - rebound double - double that also included four assists , a pair of steals and a block . Unsurprisingly , the productive outing came against a Nets defense that has allowed the most points per game ( 22 ) to opposing centers this season . Fournier made it three starters with double - digit scoring by tallying 13 points , which he supplemented with three assists , a rebound and a pair of steals . Aaron Gordon had an efficient 14 - point , five - rebound effort off the bench over 23 minutes to lead the Orlando reserves . The Magic improved to 20 - 17 and are currently in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They head home to face the Wizards on Saturday . The Nets ' ninth straight home loss was due in large part to the suffocating defense of an Orlando unit ranked in the top 10 in points allowed per game ( 99 ) . They stymied Brooklyn across the board , with Brook Lopez serving as the top scorer with a modest 17 points . He added eight rebounds , a steal and a block . Joe Johnson continued his solid offensive play of late with a serviceable 13 points , three assists , three rebounds and a steal .

The Cavs likely got more than they bargained for from a game Sixers squad that played them tough through all four quarters . Philadelphia 's collective defensive effort may have been the most surprising aspect of the game overall , as they managed to hold a hot Cleveland offense to a mediocre 39 percent shooting performance from the field , and 28 percent from beyond the arc . To provide some more tangible perspective on the noteworthiness of the Sixers ' effort , one has to realize the Cavs had tallied 53 and 48 percent figures , respectively , in those same categories against the Timberwolves in their most recent contest , and had also scored over 120 points in their two previous games . Cleveland was able to pull out the hard - fought victory on the back of LeBron James , who turned in a 37 - point , seven - rebound , nine - assist effort that also included a pair of steals . The other starters ' scoring contributions paled in comparison , as Kevin Love was the next closest with 15 points . However , Love was outstanding on the glass against a vulnerable Philadelphia frontcourt , hauling in 15 rebounds and adding seven assists and two steals . J.R. Smith added 14 points , three rebounds and a steal , and drained another four three - pointers in the process . Tristan Thompson had his own double - double in another start at center , collecting 10 points and grabbing 10 boards . Kyrie Irving had a second consecutive quiet game , notching eight points , five rebounds , two assists , two steals and a block over 31 minutes . Although his contributions in non - scoring categories were certainly solid , Irving notably struggled from the field , draining only three of 15 shot attempts . The Cavs improved to 26 - 9 and remain atop the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They now head to Dallas to take on the Mavericks on Tuesday . Philadelphia 's valiant effort was spearheaded by Jahlil Okafor 's 21 points , which he supplemented with seven rebounds .

He also added seven boards and a steal .

With the season winding down and only a handful of games across the league left to play , the Kings came away with a road win without DeMarcus Cousins and Rajon Rondo . Cousins was shut down for the season and Rondo was written down for rest , although it is unlikely he plays the final game on the schedule . Sacramento had little trouble getting out to a lead before halftime , but poor foul shooting down the stretch and a lowly 18 point fourth quarter gave Phoenix some daylight to catch up . The Suns were also shorthanded , as Tyson Chandler ( concussion ) was sidelined alongside Brandon Knight and Archie Goodwin ( ankle ) . Seth Curry had a career night and flashed some of his older brothers range and passing ability which had the commentators regularly saying `` we have seen the before ! `` . Curry finished with 20 points , which led all Kings scorers , and added 15 assists and three rebounds . Ben Mclemore joined Curry in the backcourt and contributed 14 points and seven rebounds , while Rudy Gay pitched in some highlight reel dunks on his way to 15 points , six rebounds and two steals . Quincy Acy was able to knock down the two needed free throws to prevent a last second chance for the Suns in the waning seconds of the fourth quarter and finished with nine points off the bench . The Phoenix starters mostly finished in double figures and that included three players who eclipsed 10 rebounds , but it was Mirza Teletovic who shined in 34 minutes off the bench . Teletovic added 26 points on 10 - of - 20 shooting , to go along with three rebounds , one assist and two steals . The undrafted 30 - year old forward has strung together an impressive five game stretch , where he has averaged 22 points on 47 percent shooting and proved to be a bright spot on the Suns underwhelming roster . Alex Len , Jon Leuer and P.J . Tucker finished with double - doubles in the points and rebounds department , and as a unit , Phoenix dominated the rebounding battle 51 - 40 , but their 41 percent shooting kept them out of the game . Both teams play their final games of the season on Wednesday , as the Kings will visit the Houston Rockets ( 40 - 41 ) in a win or go home game for James Harden 's crew , while the Suns host the playoff bound Los Angeles Clippers ( 52 - 28 ) ."

The dynamic All-Star duo of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin scored 26 points each . DeAndre Jordan , meanwhile , scored 17 and hit 9 - of - 14 from the free - throw line . In the third quarter , the Raptors began to employ the common strategy of `` hacking `` the big man in hopes of missed free - throws . Instead , Jordan hit 5 - of - 6 in a three - possession stretch , putting the Clippers up by as much as 17 . Despite a valiant comeback attempt , Los Angeles was able to maintain the sizeable lead . Toronto ( 8 - 6 ) has now lost four of its last five outings and is falling in the Eastern Conference standings . Boston is now tied with Toronto for the lead in the Atlantic Division .
