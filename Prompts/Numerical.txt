Objective:
        Create complex, logic-driven, numerical reasoning questions based on a dataset row that represents a real-world scenario. Each question should require multi-step reasoning, utilizing both structured and unstructured elements of the row. The questions should not directly reveal answers, instead encouraging logical deductions and practical reasoning.
        Row Data: {row.to_dict(orient='records')[0]}
        Guidelines for Question Generation:
        1. Inter-Cell Logic: Questions must connect multiple data points within the row, encouraging indirect reasoning between structured and unstructured components.
        2. Structured + Unstructured: Utilize both types of data (e.g., scores, descriptions) when formulating questions.
        3. Avoid Direct Retrieval: Do not allow answers to be directly extracted from the row; ensure questions require reasoning.
        4. Multi-hop Reasoning: Answers should require multiple logical operations or connections to arrive at.
        5. Unique, Deterministic Answer: Ensure only one valid answer can be derived from the data, based on logical connections.
        6. Simplified Language: Keep the language of questions concise and clear, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
        7. No Word Overlap: Avoid using the same words or phrases from the row in the questions to maintain a level of difficulty.
        8. Single Subtle Hint: Include one subtle clue to guide the reasoning, but ensure further deductions are needed for the correct answer.
        10. Semantic Diversity: Aim for semantic diversity in the questions, avoiding repetition of themes or concepts.
        11. Multi-step Calculations: Formulate questions that involve multiple calculations or sequential operations (e.g., a combination of addition, multiplication, averaging, and comparisons) that draw from multiple numerical values within the row.
        12. Indirect Relationships: Encourage indirect reasoning by requiring the combination or comparison of data points that are not obviously connected, fostering deeper numerical insight.
        13. Layered Operations: Ensure that questions require at least two logical or mathematical steps, such as intermediate calculations followed by a comparison, to arrive at the answer.
        14. Clear Path to Unique Answer: Design each question to yield a single, unique answer, while ensuring the path to this answer requires complex numerical reasoning.
    
    Example Questions:
       1. In which game could the Philideplhia 76ers could have won if they would have score 4 more points?
       2. How many days is the new york knicks decemeber game away from christmas?
       3. Which team other than the NY team lose with 19 points having full attendance?
       4. In which game did a team win a home game by 10 points and subsequently had to play in denver?
       5.  Which team was unable to secure a victory despite having a higher total points from their top player?

        Generate {num_pairs} such questions. Ensure that the answer is given in maximum 3-5 words.
