Objective:
        Create complex, logic-driven, temporal questions based on a dataset row that represents a real-world scenario. Each question should require multi-step reasoning, utilizing both structured and unstructured elements of the row. The questions should not directly reveal answers, instead encouraging logical deductions and practical reasoning.
        Row Data: {row.to_dict(orient='records')[0]}
        Guidelines for Question Generation:
        1. Inter-Cell Logic: Questions must connect multiple data points within the row, encouraging indirect reasoning between structured and unstructured components.
        2. Structured + Unstructured: Utilize both types of data (e.g., scores, descriptions) when formulating questions.
        3. Avoid Direct Retrieval: Do not allow answers to be directly extracted from the row; ensure questions require reasoning.
        4. Multi-hop Reasoning: Answers should require multiple logical operations or connections to arrive at.
        5. Unique, Deterministic Answer: Ensure only one valid answer can be derived from the data, based on logical connections.
        6. Simplified Language: Keep the language of questions concise and clear, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
        7. No Word Overlap: Avoid using the same words or phrases from the row in the questions to maintain a level of difficulty.
        8. Single Subtle Hint: Include one subtle clue to guide the reasoning, but ensure further deductions are needed for the correct answer.
        10. Semantic Diversity: Aim for semantic diversity in the questions, avoiding repetition of themes or concepts.
        11. Time Based Nature: The question should be temporal in nature, that is, it should utilize various elements of time to create logically diffcult question.
        12. Encourage Comparative Time Reasoning: Emphasize questions that compare events or details across different time points within the row. This could involve past events, future scenarios, or comparisons within the same game. 
        13. Focus on Season Progression and Event Timing: Emphasize questions that relate to the progression within the season, such as “early,” “mid,” or “late” season positioning
    
    Example Questions:
        1. Which time zone did the 76ers team play in the end of november?
        Reason: The question has minimum giveaways such as team name and a rough figure of the time period and is encouraging to look into the time zone of the game.
        2. In which season did Minnesota Timeberwolves win a home game?
        Reason: With the help of minimal clues such as the team name and home game it is refering to the NBA season encouraging inherent knowledge
        3. How many days rest do the Cleveland Cavaliers have before their next game?
        Reason: The summary mentions when the Cleveland Cavaliers play next sothis encourages simple numerical reasoning over time elements
        4. Does the game between knicks and 76ers take place in regular NBA season?
        Reason: By looking at the row having the games between the two teams, you have to tell whether it is normal NBA season or off season
        5. Which team faced a significant disadvantage due to a key player's injury while playing in February?
        Reason: Combines a key information in summary with the month in which the game was played
        6. Which team won against a division leader with a notable performance in December?
        7. What was the result of a matchup where one team scored 99 points and the event took place on a January weekday in California?
       
        Generate {num_pairs} such questions. Ensure that the answer is given in maximum 3-5 words.
